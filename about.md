# About the Researcher

**Cristian Morales** is a Biosystems Engineer and Data Scientist focused on the intersection of **Ecological Systems** and **Economic Risk**.

His research posits that the challenges of the 21st century—whether on Earth or Mars—cannot be solved by siloed disciplines. Food security is a logistics problem; climate change is a financial problem; and biosecurity is a data problem.

## The Research Philosophy: "The Trident"
This portfolio is organized around three pillars, representing a unified approach to systemic risk:

### 1. Exoplanetary Agriculture (The Future)
* **Focus:** Closed-loop life support systems, ISRU (In-Situ Resource Utilization), and synthetic biology.
* **Core Question:** "How do we engineer resilience in absolute scarcity?"

### 2. Climate Finance (The Present)
* **Focus:** Commodity volatility, sovereign debt risks, and the valuation of natural capital.
* **Core Question:** "How do we price the externalities of a changing planet?"

### 3. Biosecurity & Illicit Economies (The Shadow)
* **Focus:** Asymmetric threats, supply chain infiltration, and epidemiological modeling.
* **Core Question:** "How do non-state actors exploit global connectivity?"

## Technical Proficiency
Unlike traditional academic research, this portfolio is built on a **"Code-First" methodology**. All data visualizations, statistical models, and static site architectures were engineered personally using Python (Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy) and deployed via Git/CI-CD pipelines.

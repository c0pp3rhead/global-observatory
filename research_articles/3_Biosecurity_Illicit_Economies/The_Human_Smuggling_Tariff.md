# The Human Smuggling Tariff: Enforcement Price Elasticity

## 1. Abstract
Border enforcement is often sold as a deterrent. Economic theory suggests it acts more like a "Tax." This note models the **Price Elasticity** of human smuggling fees ("Coyote" rates) relative to border wall construction and patrol density.

## 2. The Hypothesis
As enforcement makes crossing harder, it does not necessarily stop migration; it makes the service of professional smugglers more valuable. It raises the "Barrier to Entry," driving out amateurs and consolidating the market for organized cartels.

## 3. Data Analysis
We aggregated migrant interview data on smuggling fees paid (2010-2025) and compared it to US Border Patrol budgets.
* **Correlation:** Strong positive correlation. A 10% increase in enforcement spend correlates with a ~15% increase in smuggling fees [1].
* **Elasticity:** Demand is relatively **inelastic**. Desperation drives migration regardless of cost; migrants simply take on more debt (indentured servitude) to pay the higher fees.

## 4. The "Cartel Subsidy"
Ironically, stricter enforcement acts as a subsidy for cartels. By making the border "hard," the state ensures that every migrant *must* hire a cartel-affiliated guide. This transfers wealth from poor migrants directly to organized crime.

## 5. Conclusion
Policy must recognize the economic feedback loops of enforcement. Without addressing the "Push Factors" (demand), supply-side interdiction merely increases the profitability of the illicit service provider.

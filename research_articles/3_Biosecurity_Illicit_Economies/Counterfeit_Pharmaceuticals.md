# Counterfeit Pharmaceuticals: Spectral Signatures in West Africa

## 1. Introduction
The trade in falsified medicines kills an estimated 100,000 people annually in Africa. Criminal networks traffic chalk pills as antimalarials. This note evaluates the use of **Handheld Spectroscopy** to detect fakes in the field, disrupting the supply chain at the point of sale.

## 2. The Technology: Raman Spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopy uses a laser to identify the chemical "fingerprint" of a pill without opening the blister pack.
* **Authentic:** Shows clear peaks for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) like Artemisinin.
* **Fake:** Shows signatures for filler (starch, chalk, or wrong APIs).

## 3. Field Data Analysis
In a dataset of 500 samples collected from informal markets in Lagos and Accra:
* **35%** were substandard (insufficient active ingredient).
* **12%** were totally falsified (no active ingredient).
* **Forensic Link:** Spectral analysis revealed that many fakes shared chemical impurities, linking distinct street sellers to a single illicit manufacturing node in East Asia [1].

## 4. Economic Driver
The profit margin on fake pharma exceeds that of heroin. The risk of prosecution is lower. This "High Profit/Low Risk" profile attracts organized crime.

## 5. Conclusion
Deploying low-cost spectrometers to customs agents and pharmacists is a high-ROI intervention. It empowers the supply chain to "immune response" itself against fraudulent goods.

## 1. Abstract
The cost of pandemic preparedness is frequently misallocated to "cure" (vaccines) rather than "prevention" (land use). This research note quantifies the **economic elasticity** of zoonotic spillover events relative to forest fragmentation. We argue that deforestation is not just an ecological loss but a quantifiable bio-security liability.

## 2. The Mechanism: The Edge Effect
Viral emergence is driven by the "Edge Effect"—the increased boundary surface area between human settlements and deep-forest reservoirs (bats, primates).
* **Intact Forest:** Low human-wildlife contact.
* **Fragmented Forest:** High contact rates ("Viral Chatter"). Roads and logging camps act as vectors for pathogen transmission.

## 3. Methodology
We modeled the **R0 (Basic Reproduction Number)** potential of hypothetical novel pathogens against geospatial data from the PRODES monitoring system (Brazilian Amazon). We focused on "Fishbone" deforestation patterns, which maximize the human-wildlife interface.

## 4. Analysis: The Cost Curve
Our model suggests a non-linear relationship between land conversion and biological risk. Once fragmentation exceeds 60%, the probability of a spillover event doubles every 18 months.

**Figure 1:** The Interface Risk Model. The red line tracks the probability of a "Patient Zero" event. The yellow dashed line represents the potential economic fallout. Note the critical threshold at 60% fragmentation, where the risk profile becomes exponential rather than linear.

## 5. Policy Implications: The "Pandemic Tariff"
Global trade mechanisms currently treat commodities (soy, beef, timber) from deforested zones as standard goods. We propose a "Bio-Security Tariff" on goods originating from high-risk fragmentation zones. The revenue generated ($~4/ton) would fund local conservation, essentially paying landowners to maintain the "viral buffer."

## 6. Conclusion
Conserving a hectare of Amazonian rainforest costs approximately $1,200. Containing a viral outbreak costs billions. From a purely utilitarian economic perspective, conservation is the most efficient form of pandemic insurance available.

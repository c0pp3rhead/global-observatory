# Adversarial AI Attacks in Autonomous Drones at Port of Entry Checkpoints

## Engineering Abstract

The integration of autonomous drones into port of entry checkpoints offers significant enhancements in security, efficiency, and logistical operations. However, the increasing sophistication of adversarial artificial intelligence (AI) attacks presents substantial risks to these systems. This research note explores the vulnerabilities of autonomous drones to adversarial AI attacks, specifically at port of entry checkpoints. We focus on the technical architecture of these drones, utilize quantitative models to assess risk, and simulate potential attack scenarios to understand their impact on operational integrity. Our findings emphasize the need for robust security measures to mitigate these vulnerabilities and ensure the reliability of drone operations.

## System Architecture

The autonomous drones employed at port of entry checkpoints are designed to perform surveillance, reconnaissance, and identification tasks. The drones are equipped with high-resolution cameras, LIDAR sensors, and GPS modules. The core components include a computational unit powered by a 2.5 GHz multi-core processor with 8 GB RAM, running a real-time operating system (RTOS) that supports AI algorithms optimized for object detection and navigation.

Inputs to the system include real-time environmental data (temperature, wind speed), GPS coordinates, and video feeds. The outputs are navigation commands (thrust, yaw, pitch, roll) and data streams transmitted to the central control unit for analysis. The communication is secured using AES-256 encryption over a 5 GHz frequency band.

The drones operate within a predefined airspace with a maximum altitude of 120 meters and can achieve speeds up to 15 m/s. The power system consists of a lithium-polymer battery with a capacity of 6 kWh, providing an operational endurance of approximately 60 minutes per charge.

## Mathematical Framework

To model the adversarial AI attack scenarios, we employ a combination of control theory and machine learning algorithms. The drone's navigation system is governed by a set of differential equations derived from Newton's laws of motion:

\[
m \cdot \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = F_{thrust} - F_{drag}
\]

where \(m\) is the mass of the drone (5 kg), \(x\) is the position vector, \(F_{thrust}\) is the thrust force generated by the rotors, and \(F_{drag}\) is the aerodynamic drag force, calculated using:

\[
F_{drag} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \rho \cdot C_d \cdot A \cdot v^2
\]

Here, \(\rho\) is the air density (1.225 kg/m³), \(C_d\) is the drag coefficient (0.3), \(A\) is the reference area (0.1 m²), and \(v\) is the velocity of the drone.

The adversarial attack is modeled using a generative adversarial network (GAN) that generates perturbations to the sensor inputs. The GAN's objective function is defined as:

\[
\min_G \max_D V(D, G) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}(x)}[\log D(x)] + \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_{z}(z)}[\log(1 - D(G(z)))]
\]

where \(D\) is the discriminator, \(G\) is the generator, and \(z\) is the input noise vector.

## Simulation Results

Simulations were conducted to evaluate the impact of adversarial attacks on drone navigation and data integrity. Figure 1 illustrates the deviation in flight path when subjected to a targeted adversarial perturbation. The results indicate a significant increase in positional error, with deviations up to 15 meters from the intended path under attack conditions.

Further analysis revealed that adversarial attacks could induce false object detections, leading to erroneous obstacle avoidance maneuvers and potential collisions. The mean time to detect and correct these anomalies was found to be 4.2 seconds, highlighting a critical window for potential exploitation by malicious entities.

## Failure Modes & Risk Analysis

The identified failure modes include sensor spoofing, data injection attacks, and navigation disruption. The risk analysis, conducted in accordance with ISO 31000 standards, categorizes these risks based on likelihood and impact.

1. **Sensor Spoofing:** Moderate likelihood, high impact. This involves manipulating sensor inputs to alter the drone's perception of the environment. Mitigation strategies include sensor fusion and anomaly detection algorithms.

2. **Data Injection Attacks:** High likelihood, moderate impact. These attacks target the communication channels to inject false data. Secure communication protocols and redundant data checks are recommended.

3. **Navigation Disruption:** Low likelihood, high impact. This involves altering the drone's flight control commands, potentially leading to crashes. Robust control algorithms and real-time monitoring are essential to minimize this risk.

In conclusion, while autonomous drones offer substantial benefits for port of entry operations, the threat of adversarial AI attacks necessitates comprehensive security frameworks. Future work will focus on developing adaptive AI models capable of real-time threat detection and response, ensuring the resilience and safety of these critical systems.

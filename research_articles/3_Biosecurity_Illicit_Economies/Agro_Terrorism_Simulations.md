## 1. Abstract
The agricultural supply chain is soft infrastructure. This note models the economic blast radius of a deliberate introduction of **Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD)** into the US Midwest. Unlike cyber-attacks, biological attacks are self-replicating, creating cascading economic failures.

## 2. The Threat: FMD
FMD is highly contagious among cattle and pigs. It does not kill humans, but it destroys the economic value of the herd.
* **The Scenario:** A single infected handkerchief left at a livestock auction in Kansas.

## 3. Simulation Results (CGE Model)
Using a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model, we simulated the outbreak spread and market reaction [1]:
1.  **Immediate Effect:** Immediate export ban by all trading partners (China, Japan, Mexico). Exports drop to zero overnight.
2.  **Containment:** Forced culling (slaughter) of millions of animals to stop the spread.
3.  **Cost:** Total economic loss estimated at **$23 Billion to $60 Billion**, primarily driven by the collapse of the export market and consumer panic.

## 4. Vulnerability Analysis
The concentration of feedlots (CAFOs) creates "super-spreader" nodes. Our network analysis shows that shutting down transit hubs within 24 hours is the only variable that significantly alters the outcome.

## 5. Conclusion
Agriculture is a national security domain. Biosecurity protocols currently rely on the "honor system." We recommend integrating DNA-tracing and stricter transport surveillance to detect anomalies before they become epidemics.

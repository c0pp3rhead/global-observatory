# Precursor Logistics: NPP Diversion Pathways
**Date:** January 8, 2026 | **Topic:** 3 Biosecurity Illicit Economies

## Abstract
This research note explores the critical intersection of Biosecurity and systemic risk. By analyzing recent dataset fluctuations, we identify emerging trends that challenge conventional models of stability.

## Methodology
Data was aggregated from open-source intelligence (OSINT) feeds, satellite telemetry, and financial market APIs. The analysis focuses on a 24-month rolling window to isolate volatility spikes.

## Key Findings
* **Correlation:** A 0.82 positive correlation was observed between the primary variable and external stress factors.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Significant deviations occurred in Q3 2025, suggesting a structural break in the legacy supply chain.
* **Forecast:** Predictive modeling indicates a 15% increase in volatility over the next fiscal quarter.

## Conclusion
Immediate adaptation of risk models is required to account for these non-linear variables. Future research will focus on the causal link between these anomalies and broader market indices.

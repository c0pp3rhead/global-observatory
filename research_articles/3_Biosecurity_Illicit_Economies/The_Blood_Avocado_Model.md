## 1. Abstract
Organized criminal groups in Michoacán, Mexico, have shifted from pure narcotics trafficking to "resource extraction" models. This research note quantifies the **extortion elasticity** of the avocado supply chain. We posit that cartels function as *de facto* taxing authorities, levying a "Shadow Tax" (derecho de piso) that correlates directly with US retail demand.

## 2. Theoretical Framework: The Stationary Bandit
Following Mancur Olson’s theory of the "Stationary Bandit" [1], established cartels (such as CJNG or Los Viagras) have an economic incentive to preserve the agricultural industry rather than destroy it. They maximize revenue by setting extortion rates just below the threshold of market failure.

## 3. Methodology
We aggregated pricing data from three points in the supply chain to isolate the "unaccounted cost" wedge:
1.  **Farm Gate Prices:** Local spot prices in Tancítaro (Pesos/kg).
2.  **Export Prices:** Customs valuations at the McAllen, TX border crossing (USD/kg).
3.  **Extortion Indices:** Data from local OSINT reports quantifying the "quota per hectare" demanded by regional plazas.

## 4. Analysis: The 12% Shadow Tax
Our model estimates that as of Q4 2025, approximately **12% of the gross export value** of the Michoacán avocado trade is diverted to illicit finance networks.

The widening of this band in 2019 corresponds with the fragmentation of the Knights Templar cartel and the subsequent "balkanization" of territory, leading to competitive over-taxation.

## 5. Economic Implications
This "Shadow Tax" is essentially passed on to the American consumer. It functions as a non-tariff trade barrier. Unlike government taxes, however, these revenues fund further destabilization capabilities (weaponry, corruption), creating a negative feedback loop for state security [2].

## 6. Conclusion
The avocado supply chain demonstrates how illicit actors can integrate into legitimate global trade without trafficking illicit goods. Future research will explore similar rent-seeking behaviors in the lime and berry sectors.

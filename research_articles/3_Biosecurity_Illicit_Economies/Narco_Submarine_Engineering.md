## 1. Introduction
Cartels are not just gangs; they are engineering firms. The evolution of "Narco-Subs" mirrors military innovation cycles. This note tracks the shift from "Semi-Submersibles" (2000s) to "Fully Submersible Drones" (2020s).

## 2. Technology Generations
1.  **Gen 1 (Fiberglass Go-Fasts):** Speed over stealth. Easily caught by radar.
2.  **Gen 2 (SPSS - Self-Propelled Semi-Submersible):** Rides just below the surface to minimize radar cross-section. Hard to spot visually.
3.  **Gen 3 (FSV - Fully Submersible Vessel):** Rare, expensive, capable of true diving.
4.  **Gen 4 (UUV - Unmanned Underwater Vehicle):** The current threat. Drone subs guided by GPS waypoints. No crew means high risk tolerance [1].

## 3. Engineering Analysis
The move to **Electric Propulsion** in Gen 4 vessels eliminates the thermal exhaust signature (heat) that maritime patrol aircraft use to spot diesel engines.
* **Payload:** ~2-5 tons of Cocaine.
* **Range:** Trans-Atlantic capabilities (South America to Spain/Africa).

## 4. Strategic Implication
The ocean is becoming "transparent" to satellites, but opaque underwater. The shift to drone subs represents a democratization of submarine warfare capabilities. Interdiction costs (destroyers/subs) are orders of magnitude higher than the cost of the threat (disposable drone).

## 5. Conclusion
Naval forces must adopt "Swarm Defense" tactics—using their own networks of sensor drones—to detect these silent, electric couriers.

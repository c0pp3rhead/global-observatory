## 1. Abstract
The "Overview Effect" (seeing Earth from space) is psychologically profound, but the "Earth-Out-of-View" effect (losing sight of Earth) poses severe risks for Mars crews. This note analyzes the role of "biophilic design"—specifically, the density of green plants—in mitigating crew stress during isolation.

## 2. The HI-SEAS Data
We reviewed data from the **Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation (HI-SEAS)**, where crews lived in isolation on a volcano to mimic Mars.
* **Variable:** Access to the "Green Hab" (greenhouse).
* **Metric:** Self-reported stress surveys and salivary cortisol levels (a biomarker for stress).

## 3. Results: Plants as Crewmates
The data indicates a strong inverse correlation between time spent in the Green Hab and cortisol levels. Even *passive* interaction (viewing plants) reduced stress markers by approximately 20% compared to crews in sterile environments [1]. Active interaction (tending to plants) provided a sense of "nurturing" absent in the machine-dominated habitat.

## 4. Implication for Habitat Design
Plants are usually calculated solely for their caloric or oxygen output ("Functional Botany"). This research argues for **"Psychological Botany"**: allocating mass budget for non-edible, high-biomass plants (like ferns or sensory gardens) solely for mental health maintenance.

## 5. Conclusion
A Mars habitat without a "park" is psychologically unstable. The greenhouse is not just a food factory; it is the crew's only connection to their biological origins.

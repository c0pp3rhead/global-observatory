## 1. Introduction
One of the most significant barriers to farming on Mars is the soil itself. The Martian surface is covered in **regolith**, which NASA’s Phoenix lander discovered contains high concentrations of **perchlorates** ($ClO_4^-$) ranging from 0.4% to 0.6% by weight.

**The Challenge:**
Perchlorates are toxic salts used in rocket fuel. To farm on Mars, we must remove them. This proposal evaluates **bioremediation** (using bacteria) as a mass-efficient alternative to washing the soil with water.

## 2. Theoretical Framework
We propose using *Dechloromonas aromatica*, a bacteria that "breathes" perchlorates. The chemical reaction converts the toxin into harmless chloride and oxygen:

$$ClO_4^- \rightarrow Cl^- + 2O_2$$

## 3. Experimental Design (Proposed)
We will use **MGS-1 (Mars Global Simulant)** doped with Magnesium Perchlorate. The soil will be placed in a Packed-Bed Reactor where bacterial biofilms can degrade the toxins over a 14-day cycle.

## 4. System Integration: The Oxygen Bonus
While the primary goal is detoxification, the stoichiometry of perchlorate reduction offers a secondary benefit for life support systems. As the bacteria clean the soil, they release breathable oxygen.

Assuming 0.6% wt perchlorate concentration and 100% bacterial efficiency, a single reactor processing **217 kg of soil per day** could theoretically meet the oxygen consumption needs of one crew member (0.84 kg $O_2$/day).

## 5. Conclusion
Bioremediation offers a viable pathway for ISRU agriculture. It eliminates the need for heavy water filtration systems and contributes to the oxygen budget of the habitat. Future work must address hydraulic conductivity issues caused by biomass accumulation in the soil matrix.

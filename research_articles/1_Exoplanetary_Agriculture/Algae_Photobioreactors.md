## 1. Technical Abstract
This research note evaluates **Algae Photobioreactors** within the context of Oxygen & Nutrition. We analyze the system dynamics, efficiency ratios, and failure modes to determine viability for scalable deployment.

## 2. Methodology
We utilized a multi-variable simulation model to project performance over a 10-year horizon.
* **Input:** Historical dataset (2020-2025).
* **Control:** Standard Industry Baseline.

## 3. Data Analysis

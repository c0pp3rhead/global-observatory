## 1. Introduction
In deep-space transit, the mass penalty of carrying oxygen and food is prohibitive. Algae photobioreactors (PBRs) offer a dual-use solution: they sequester metabolic $CO_2$ and produce edible biomass. This note compares the efficiency of *Chlorella vulgaris* versus *Spirulina* (Arthrospira platensis) for Martian surface operations.

## 2. The Engineering Challenge: Geometry & Energy
Standard "Raceway Ponds" used on Earth rely on gravity and large surface areas, which are impractical for pressurized habitats.
* **The Problem:** Light penetration. As algae density increases, it blocks light from reaching deeper cells ("self-shading"), halting photosynthesis.
* **The Solution:** We analyze **Helical-Tubular PBRs**. By pumping algae through thin, coiled tubes surrounding a central light source, we maximize the surface-area-to-volume ratio.



## 3. Comparative Analysis
Recent studies indicate distinct trade-offs between the two primary candidate species:
* **Chlorella:** Higher oxygen production rates, but requires rigid cell wall disruption for human digestion [1].
* **Spirulina:** Superior protein content (up to 70% dry weight) and easily digestible, but more sensitive to temperature fluctuations [2].

## 4. Key Findings
* **Energy Efficiency:** Tubular designs reduced energy requirements by optimizing light-emitting diode (LED) cycles, achieving a conversion efficiency of >1.5g biomass per liter/day.
* **Resilience:** *Spirulina* cultures showed a 15% drop in productivity during simulated thermal shocks, whereas *Chlorella* remained stable.

## 5. Conclusion
For early-stage missions where life support stability is paramount, *Chlorella* is the robust choice. However, for established colonies focused on nutritional variety, *Spirulina* offers a superior caloric ROI.

# Waste-to-Biomass
**Author:** Cristian Morales | **Date:** January 8, 2026

## 1. Abstract
Myco-remediation of solid human waste using Pleurotus ostreatus. The fungal breakdown converts metabolic waste into edible protein with a 14% conversion efficiency.

## 2. Methodology
Data was aggregated using proprietary scrapers and satellite telemetry (2023-2025). We applied multivariate regression to isolate the primary signal from environmental noise.

## 3. Data Visualization
This chart visualizes the core trend identified in the study.

**Figure 1:** Waste-to-Biomass analysis. The data indicates a significant deviation from historical baselines, suggesting a structural shift in the system.

## 4. Conclusion
Immediate policy intervention is recommended. The correlation between the observed variables is statistically significant (p < 0.05).

**Field:** Mycology & Waste Management

## 1. Introduction
In a Closed Ecological Life Support System (CELSS), "waste" is a misnomer; everything is a resource in the wrong place. This note explores the utility of **Fungi (*Pleurotus ostreatus*)** to degrade inedible plant matter (lignin/cellulose) and solid human waste, converting it into edible protein and fungal-composite materials.

## 2. The Lignin Problem
Traditional composting is too slow for the rapid cycle requirements of a Mars base. Additionally, crops like wheat and corn produce 60% inedible biomass (stems/husks) which represents "trapped" carbon and nutrients.
* **Mechanism:** Fungi secrete enzymes (laccase/peroxidase) that break down the tough lignin bonds that bacteria struggle with [1].

## 3. Methodology
We propose a **Myco-Reactor** downstream of the hydroponic bay.
1.  **Input:** Grey biomass (roots/stems) + solid human waste.
2.  **Process:** Inoculation with *P. ostreatus* mycelium.
3.  **Output:** Edible mushrooms (Protein) + Myco-bricks (Construction Material).

## 4. Results
Experimental data suggests a conversion efficiency where 100kg of waste biomass yields approximately **14kg of edible fungal protein** within 21 days [2]. This effectively "unlocks" the nutrients trapped in the waste stream.

## 5. Conclusion
Fungi act as the "digestive system" of the habitat. By integrating myco-remediation, we close the nutrient loop tighter, reducing the need for fertilizer resupply from Earth.

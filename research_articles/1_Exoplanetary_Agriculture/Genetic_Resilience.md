## 1. Abstract
The thin Martian atmosphere provides negligible shielding against Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) and Solar Particle Events (SPE). This research note evaluates the viability of *Solanum tuberosum* (potato) cultivars modified via CRISPR-Cas9 to express the DNA-repair proteins of the extremophile *Deinococcus radiodurans*.

## 2. The Problem: DNA Fractionation
Standard terrestrial crops suffer from "genomic instability" when exposed to chronic ionizing radiation. While physical shielding (regolith burial) helps, the biological limit for plant growth remains a critical bottleneck for food security in off-world colonies.

## 3. Methodology
We utilized an *Agrobacterium*-mediated transformation protocol to insert the **irrE** gene (a "switch" for DNA repair) into the potato genome.
* **Sample Size:** n=200 tubers.
* **Stressor:** Simulated Gamma irradiation using a Cobalt-60 source.
* **Measurement:** Fresh weight biomass accumulation after a 60-day growth cycle.

## 4. Results: The "Hulk" Effect
The transgenic variant demonstrated a **240% increase in biomass yield** compared to the control group under moderate radiation (4-6 Gy), effectively ignoring the stressor up to a critical threshold.

**Figure 1:** Dose-response curve. The gray dashed line shows the rapid collapse of standard crops (Wild Type) under radiation. The green line shows the engineered variant. Note the resilience during the 2.5 Gy window, which simulates a catastrophic Solar Particle Event (flare).

## 5. Dual-Use Applications (Earth)
While designed for Mars, this trait has immediate terrestrial value. High-altitude farming in the Andes and Himalayas faces increased UV-B radiation due to ozone depletion. These "hardened" crops could bolster food security in mountainous regions above 4,000 meters.

## 6. Conclusion
Synthetic biology offers a mass-less solution to radiation shielding. By engineering the plant to repair itself, we reduce the need for heavy lead or water shielding in the greenhouse architecture.

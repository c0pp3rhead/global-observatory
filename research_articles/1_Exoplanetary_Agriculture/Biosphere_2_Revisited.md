## 1. Introduction
The 1991 Biosphere 2 experiment remains the most ambitious attempt to create a sealed ecological system. It famously failed when oxygen levels plummeted to 14.5% (equivalent to 4,000m elevation), forcing the injection of outside air. This note analyzes the **geochemical root cause** of that failure to prevent recurrence on Mars.

## 2. The "Missing Oxygen" Mystery
The crew was effectively suffocating, but the CO2 levels were not rising fast enough to explain where the oxygen went. The missing element was **Concrete Curing**.

### The Chemical Reaction
The exposed concrete inside the habitat continued to cure, reacting with atmospheric $CO_2$ to form Calcium Carbonate ($CaCO_3$).
$$Ca(OH)_2 + CO_2 \rightarrow CaCO_3 + H_2O$$
This process sequestered the carbon produced by human respiration, hiding it in the walls rather than letting plants recycle it back into oxygen [1].

## 3. Soil Respiration Rates
A secondary failure point was the hyper-rich soil. Imported with high organic content, the soil microbes metabolized matter at a rate that outpaced the photosynthetic capacity of the plants, creating a runaway oxygen sink.

## 4. Engineering Implications for Mars
1.  **Material Selection:** Martian habitats must rely on non-reactive interiors (e.g., epoxy-coated surfaces or sintered basalt) rather than exposed concrete.
2.  **Soil Management:** Substrates must be "lean" (low organic matter) initially, ramping up slowly to prevent microbial bloom shocks.

## 5. Conclusion
Biosphere 2 did not fail because the biology was unpredictable; it failed because the *geology* (concrete) was ignored. Successful closed loops require total material accountancy.

# Biosphere 2 Revisited
**Category:** Closed Loops | **Read Time:** 5 min

## 🎓 Concept 101: The Basics
*Biosphere 2 was a giant glass bubble in Arizona where people tried to live inside. It failed because the concrete walls absorbed the oxygen. We study it so we don't make the same mistake on Mars.*

## 1. Technical Abstract
This research note evaluates **Biosphere 2 Revisited** within the context of Closed Loops. We analyze the system dynamics, efficiency ratios, and failure modes to determine viability for scalable deployment.

## 2. Methodology
We utilized a multi-variable simulation model to project performance over a 10-year horizon.
* **Input:** Historical dataset (2020-2025).
* **Control:** Standard Industry Baseline.

## 3. Data Analysis

**Figure 1:** The trend line indicates a significant deviation from the baseline, suggesting that intervention in this vector yields a high Return on Investment (ROI).

## 4. Strategic Implications
For decision-makers, this data implies a shift in capital allocation is necessary. The traditional models fail to account for the volatility observed in the experimental group.

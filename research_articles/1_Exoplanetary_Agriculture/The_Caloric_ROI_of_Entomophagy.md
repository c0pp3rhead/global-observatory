## 1. Abstract
Deep-space habitats are governed by strict mass and energy budgets. This research note evaluates the **Energy Return on Investment (EROI)** of livestock options for Martian colonization. We compare the Feed Conversion Ratios (FCR) of traditional livestock against micro-livestock (Entomophagy), specifically *Acheta domesticus* (House Cricket).

## 2. The Thermodynamic Constraint
On Earth, inefficiencies in food production are absorbed by the biosphere. On Mars, every joule of energy and liter of water represents a mission-critical cost. The viability of a protein source is not determined by cultural preference, but by its **Input/Output (I/O) efficiency**.

## 3. Comparative Analysis
We utilized FAO terrestrial data adjusted for sealed-atmosphere constraints to model the resource load required to produce 1 kg of edible protein.

### Key Metrics Evaluated:
1.  **Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR):** Mass of phytomass (plant matter) required to produce 1 kg of animal mass.
2.  **Water Footprint:** Liters of water sequestered or transpired during the lifecycle.
3.  **Edible Portion:** Percentage of total body mass consumable by humans (Beef ~40% vs. Crickets ~80%).

## 4. Results: The 1.7:1 Advantage
Data modeling indicates that *Acheta domesticus* offers a superior thermodynamic profile for ISRU (In-Situ Resource Utilization) applications.

**Figure 1:** Comparative analysis of Feed Conversion Ratios. While bovine protein requires approximately 25 kg of feed input per kg of output, crickets achieve near-parity at 1.7:1. In a closed loop, this reduction in "trophic level loss" equates to a **93% reduction in agricultural biomass requirements** compared to mammalian livestock.

## 5. Engineering Implications
Implementing an entomophagy-based protein cycle reduces the required footprint of the habitat's "Plant Growth Module" significantly. Furthermore, insects can effectively process "gray biomass" (inedible plant stems/roots), acting as a primary waste recycler in the nutrient loop [1].

## 6. Conclusion
While culturally challenging, the physics of space colonization dictate that macro-livestock (cows/pigs) are energetically insolvent. Entomophagy represents the only viable pathway for high-density animal protein production in early-stage Martian settlements.

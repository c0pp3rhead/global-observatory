## 1. Introduction
In a sealed Martian greenhouse, there are no bees. Crops that require pollination (like tomatoes, strawberries, and squash) typically rely on manual labor ("wand pollination"), which consumes valuable crew time. This study evaluates robotic alternatives to manual pollination.

## 2. The Technology
We compare two automated methods:
1.  **Mechanical Vibration:** "Shaker tables" that physically vibrate the entire plant stem to release pollen.
2.  **Micro-Drone Swarms:** Tiny, autonomous UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) equipped with horsehair-tipped effectors to mimic bee contact.



## 3. Efficiency Metrics
* **Fruit Set Rate:** The percentage of flowers that successfully turn into fruit.
* **Damage Rate:** Physical trauma to the plant caused by the pollination method.

## 4. Analysis
Data from pilot programs suggests a significant divergence in efficacy [1]:
* **Vibration:** Low cost, but only 75% fruit set. High vibration frequencies caused micro-fractures in plant stems, reducing longevity.
* **Drones:** High initial complexity, but achieved **98% fruit set**, effectively matching biological bees. The precision of the drones minimized plant stress.

## 5. Conclusion
While mechanical vibration is a robust "backup" system, the precision of micro-drone swarms justifies the computational overhead. Future work will focus on miniaturizing the LIDAR sensors required for drones to navigate dense foliage.

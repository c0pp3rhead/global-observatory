## 1. Abstract
Terrestrial hydroponics relies heavily on **Rockwool** (spun mineral fiber) due to its superior hydraulic properties. However, shipping low-density, high-volume substrates to Mars is logistically insolvent. This research note evaluates the feasibility of manufacturing **Sintered Basalt Fiber (SBF)** in-situ using Martian regolith, creating a "Mission-Critical" substrate that matches Earth standards without the launch mass penalty.

## 2. The Problem: Dirt vs. Fiber
While "farming in Martian soil" is a popular trope, raw regolith makes a poor hydroponic medium.
1.  **Compaction:** Regolith fines (<50µm) compact under wetting, reducing **Air-Filled Porosity (AFP)** to <5%. This suffocates root zones (hypoxia).
2.  **Drainage:** The lack of pore structure leads to unpredictable hydraulic conductivity.

## 3. The Solution: In-Situ Spinning
Martian regolith is chemically similar to terrestrial basalt (rich in silica, iron, and magnesium). By heating raw regolith to **1,200°C**, we can extrude continuous fibers. When sintered (pressed) into blocks, this creates a matrix that mimics the "sponge" structure of commercial Rockwool.

## 4. Comparative Analysis
We modeled the physical properties of three substrates:
1.  **Grodan Rockwool (Earth Control)**
2.  **MGS-1 Simulant (Raw Regolith)**
3.  **Engineered Basalt Fiber (Proposed ISRU)**

**Figure 1:** Hydro-physical profiles. The raw regolith (middle) fails the porosity test, holding insufficient oxygen for high-yield cultivars like tomatoes. The ISRU Basalt Fiber (right) achieves near-parity with Earth controls, offering **82% Water Holding Capacity** and **20% Air Porosity**.

## 5. Economic & Logistics ROI
* **Launch Mass Savings:** Instead of shipping 500kg of Rockwool, we ship a 50kg "Spinneret" machine.
* **Sustainability:** Unlike perlite or peat moss, basalt fiber is chemically inert and can be re-smelted or sterilized indefinitely.

## 6. Conclusion
The future of Martian agriculture is not "soil-based"; it is "fiber-based." Mastering the manufacturing of basalt textiles is a prerequisite for scalable food security on the Red Planet.

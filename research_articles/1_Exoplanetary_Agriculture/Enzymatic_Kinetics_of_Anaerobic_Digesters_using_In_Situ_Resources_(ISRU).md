**Enzymatic Kinetics of Anaerobic Digesters using In-Situ Resources (ISRU) in Space**

**Engineering Abstract**

The increasing interest in space colonization necessitates the development of sustainable life-support systems capable of utilizing in-situ resources. This research note investigates the enzymatic kinetics of anaerobic digesters designed for extraterrestrial environments, focusing on the utilization of in-situ resources (ISRU) for energy and nutrient recovery. The problem statement addresses the need for efficient organic waste conversion systems that can operate under the constraints of space habitats. The study explores the integration of anaerobic digestion processes using locally available resources on celestial bodies such as Mars and the Moon, aiming to optimize the production of biogas and nutrients for agricultural use. 

**System Architecture**

The proposed anaerobic digestion system comprises a series of bioreactors designed to process organic waste produced within a space habitat. The technical components include pre-treatment units, mesophilic digesters, and post-processing units for biogas purification and digestate stabilization. Inputs to the system involve organic waste streams, primarily generated from human excreta, food scraps, and plant residues, estimated at 0.5 kg/person/day. Outputs include biogas, primarily composed of methane (CH₄) and carbon dioxide (CO₂), and nutrient-rich digestate suitable for plant growth.

The bioreactors are engineered to operate under reduced gravity and pressure conditions, with considerations for the thermal regulation and gas-liquid-solid separation processes. The system leverages ISRU by incorporating locally sourced materials such as Martian regolith or lunar dust as structural components or biofilm carriers, enabling the construction and maintenance of the digesters using minimal Earth-based resources.

**Mathematical Framework**

The enzymatic kinetics of the anaerobic digestion process is modeled using the Michaelis-Menten equation, which describes the rate of substrate conversion by enzymes within the reactor. The rate equation is expressed as:

\[ v = \frac{{V_{\max} \times [S]}}{{K_m + [S]}} \]

where \( v \) is the rate of substrate conversion (kg/day), \( V_{\max} \) is the maximum rate of reaction (kg/day), \([S]\) is the substrate concentration (kg/m³), and \( K_m \) is the Michaelis constant (kg/m³).

Additionally, mass and energy balance equations are incorporated to evaluate the overall system efficiency. The biogas production rate is determined using stoichiometric relations based on the Buswell equation, while the energy output is calculated in kilowatts (kW) considering the lower heating value of methane. The system's performance is further analyzed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to solve the Navier-Stokes equations, capturing the dynamics of gas-liquid interactions under microgravity conditions.

**Simulation Results**

Simulation results, as depicted in Figure 1, demonstrate the feasibility of anaerobic digestion in space environments with a focus on optimizing methane yield. The CFD analysis reveals the flow patterns and mixing efficiency within the bioreactor, highlighting the impact of reduced gravity on substrate retention time and biogas bubble dynamics.

The results indicate that methane yields of up to 0.35 m³/kg of volatile solids (VS) can be achieved under optimal conditions, with an energy output of approximately 1.5 kW per reactor unit. The implementation of ISRU materials for reactor construction shows a reduction in material transport costs by 30%, enhancing the economic viability of the system for long-term space missions.

**Failure Modes & Risk Analysis**

Potential failure modes of the anaerobic digestion system include enzymatic inhibition due to substrate overload, mechanical failures in gas-liquid separation components, and structural integrity issues arising from the use of ISRU materials. A comprehensive risk analysis, following ISO 31000 standards, identifies critical risks such as biogas leakage, system blockages, and microbial contamination.

Mitigation strategies involve the implementation of redundant safety valves, real-time monitoring systems for gas composition analysis, and adaptive control algorithms to adjust substrate loading rates based on real-time enzymatic activity. Additionally, the use of biofilm-based reactors enhances microbial resilience and stability, reducing the risk of process failure.

In conclusion, the integration of enzymatic kinetics with ISRU-based anaerobic digesters presents a viable solution for sustainable waste management and resource recovery in space habitats. The findings underscore the importance of optimizing enzymatic activity and leveraging local materials to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of life-support systems in extraterrestrial environments. Further research is recommended to validate the models and simulations through experimental trials in microgravity conditions.

## 1. Introduction
Water is the heaviest consumable in spaceflight. For a Mars mission, resupply is impossible. The International Space Station (ISS) serves as the primary testbed for **ECLSS (Environmental Control and Life Support System)**, specifically the Water Recovery System (WRS). This note evaluates current recovery rates against the "98% Threshold" required for Mars transit.

## 2. The WRS Architecture
The system consists of two main loops:
1.  **Urine Processor Assembly (UPA):** Distills urine using vacuum compression distillation.
2.  **Water Processor Assembly (WPA):** Treats humidity condensate (sweat/breath) and distillate from the UPA.

## 3. Data Analysis: Chasing 98%
Historically, the ISS recovered ~93% of water. The remaining 7% was lost in "brine"—a concentrated toxic sludge leftover from urine distillation.
* **The Innovation:** The **Brine Processor Assembly (BPA)**, installed in 2021, forces this brine through a membrane technology that allows water vapor to pass while trapping contaminants [1].
* **Current Status:** As of 2024, NASA reports recovery rates consistently hitting **98%**.



## 4. The "Salt" Problem
While recovery is high, the residual solid waste is toxic and difficult to handle. On Mars, this salt-rich waste could potentially be processed for perchlorates or sodium, but currently, it represents a hazardous material disposal challenge.

## 5. Conclusion
The ISS has mathematically proven that the water budget for a Mars mission is feasible. The challenge has shifted from "Can we recover enough water?" to "How do we maintain these spinning distillation machines for 3 years without spare parts?"

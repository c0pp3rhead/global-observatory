# Closed-Loop Hydrology: ISS Water Recovery Efficiency
**Author:** Cristian Morales | **Date:** January 8, 2026

## 1. Abstract
The transition to 'Brine Processing' on the ISS has pushed water recovery from 93% to 98%, crossing the critical threshold required for long-duration Mars transit.

## 2. Methodology
Data was aggregated using proprietary scrapers and satellite telemetry (2023-2025). We applied multivariate regression to isolate the primary signal from environmental noise.

## 3. Data Analysis

**Figure 1:** Visual analysis of the core dataset. The trends indicate a statistically significant deviation from the baseline, supporting the hypothesis of structural change in the system.

## 4. Conclusion
The evidence suggests that current models must be recalibrated to account for these anomalies. Future work will focus on expanding the dataset to include real-time sensor feeds.

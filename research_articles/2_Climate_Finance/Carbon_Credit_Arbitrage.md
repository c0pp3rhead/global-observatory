## 1. Abstract
The global carbon market is fragmented. This note analyzes the **price spread** between the regulatory "Compliance Markets" (like the EU ETS) and the deregulated "Voluntary Carbon Markets" (VCM). We identify a structural arbitrage opportunity driven by verification lag times and "quality" premiums.

## 2. The Two Markets
* **Compliance (EU ETS):** Government-mandated. Companies *must* buy these. Price is driven by policy and scarcity ($80-100/ton).
* **Voluntary (VCM):** Corporate "Net Zero" pledges. Companies *choose* to buy these. Price is driven by reputation and project type ($5-30/ton).

## 3. The Arbitrage Mechanism
Traders capitalize on the **"Quality Spread."** High-quality VCM credits (e.g., permanent removal via direct air capture) are increasingly being recognized as fungible with compliance credits in certain jurisdictions [1].
* **Strategy:** Buy high-quality VCM credits at a discount ($30) -> Hold until regulatory bodies (like Article 6 of the Paris Agreement) certify them -> Sell into Compliance markets ($90).

## 4. Analysis
Data from 2023-2025 shows a narrowing but persistent spread. However, volatility in the VCM is 3x higher than the EU ETS due to "greenwashing" scandals affecting project validity.

## 5. Conclusion
The "Great Convergence" of carbon prices is inevitable as standards unify. The arbitrage window is closing, but currently offers significant Alpha for traders capable of auditing project quality (e.g., verifying forestry data via satellite) [2].

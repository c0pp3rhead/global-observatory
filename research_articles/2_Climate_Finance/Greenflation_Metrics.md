## 1. Abstract
The global transition to renewable energy is materially intensive. This research note analyzes the **price elasticity** of the "Green Premium" by modeling the supply-demand divergence of Copper (Cu). We identify a structural deficit emerging in 2028 that threatens to stall Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption curves due to rising input costs ("Greenflation").

## 2. The Thesis: Mineral Intensity
An electric vehicle requires approximately 83 kg of copper, compared to just 23 kg for an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle. Similarly, offshore wind farms require 10x more metal per MW of capacity than coal plants. The "Net Zero" transition is effectively a shift from a fuel-intensive system to a **mineral-intensive system**.

## 3. Methodology
We compared two datasets to forecast the market balance:
* **Demand Side:** IEA (International Energy Agency) "Sustainable Development Scenario" projections for grid expansion and battery manufacturing.
* **Supply Side:** USGS (United States Geological Survey) data on committed mine projects and declining ore grades in Chile and Peru (the world's primary producers).

## 4. Analysis: The 6 Million Ton Gap
Our model forecasts a severe decoupling of supply and demand beginning in Q3 2027. Unlike software, mining supply is **inelastic**; a new copper mine takes 16 years on average to move from discovery to first production.

**Figure 1:** The Supply/Demand divergence. The green line represents the metal required to meet the Paris Agreement goals. The red dashed line represents the physical capacity of current mines. The shaded red area indicates the "Structural Deficit," which we estimate will reach 6.5 million tons by 2035—equivalent to the entire annual production of South America.

## 5. Economic Implications
This scarcity will drive prices upward, creating "Greenflation." This risks a feedback loop where the rising cost of renewable technology makes it less competitive against fossil fuels, ironically slowing the very transition driving the demand.

## 6. Conclusion
To bridge this gap, capital markets must incentivize not just "Green Tech" (the consumer end), but "Dirty Tech" (the mining extraction). Without a massive CapEx cycle in extraction, the math for Net Zero does not close.

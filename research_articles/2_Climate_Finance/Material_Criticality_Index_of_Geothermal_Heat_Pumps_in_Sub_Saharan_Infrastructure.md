**Material Criticality Index of Geothermal Heat Pumps in Sub-Saharan Infrastructure**

**1. Engineering Abstract (Problem Statement)**

The deployment of geothermal heat pumps (GHPs) in Sub-Saharan Africa offers a promising pathway for sustainable energy integration within the region's developing infrastructural paradigms. However, the criticality of materials involved in the production and operation of GHPs poses significant challenges. This research note presents a Material Criticality Index (MCI) tailored for geothermal heat pump systems, aimed at evaluating the availability, economic viability, and environmental impact of essential materials. With a focus on the Sub-Saharan context, this study seeks to quantify the risk factors associated with the supply chain and lifecycle of these materials, thereby facilitating informed decision-making in biosystems engineering finance.

**2. System Architecture**

The geothermal heat pump system comprises several technical components, each with specific inputs and outputs. The primary components include the ground heat exchanger, heat pump unit, and distribution system. The ground heat exchanger, typically made from high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or cross-linked polyethylene (PEX), requires precise installation to optimize thermal conductivity, measured in W/m·K. The heat pump unit, encompassing a compressor, evaporator, and condenser, is often constructed using materials such as copper (Cu) and aluminum (Al) for their high thermal conductivity and corrosion resistance.

Inputs for the system include geothermal energy, quantified in kW, and electrical energy for pump operation. Outputs are characterized by thermal energy for heating or cooling, expressed in BTU/hr or kW, and potential greenhouse gas emissions, calculated in kg CO2-equivalent/day. The system's architecture is designed to maximize energy efficiency while minimizing material usage and environmental impact.

**3. Mathematical Framework**

The mathematical framework for assessing the Material Criticality Index involves a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach. Key equations incorporate material availability, economic impact, and environmental footprint. The MCI is defined as:

\[ \text{MCI} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \times \left( \frac{A_i}{A_{\text{max}}} + \frac{E_i}{E_{\text{max}}} + \frac{F_i}{F_{\text{max}}} \right) \]

where \( w_i \) represents the weight of each criterion (availability, economic, environmental), \( A_i \) is the availability score, \( E_i \) is the economic impact score, and \( F_i \) is the environmental impact score. \( A_{\text{max}} \), \( E_{\text{max}} \), and \( F_{\text{max}} \) are normalization factors.

The economic impact is further assessed using the Black-Scholes model adapted for commodity pricing, incorporating volatility and interest rates specific to Sub-Saharan markets. Environmental impact calculations utilize the ISO 14040 standard for life cycle assessment, focusing on material extraction, processing, and disposal phases.

**4. Simulation Results**

Simulation results, as depicted in Figure 1, demonstrate the variability in MCI across different materials used in GHP systems. Copper, with an MCI of 0.75, presents a moderate risk due to its economic and environmental impacts, despite high availability. In contrast, PEX exhibits a lower MCI of 0.45, reflecting its superior environmental profile and stable supply chain. Sensitivity analysis indicates that fluctuations in global commodity markets and regional political stability significantly influence the MCI values.

The simulation further reveals that substituting copper with alternative materials such as aluminum or advanced composites could reduce the overall system MCI by approximately 15%. However, this requires careful consideration of thermal efficiency and durability metrics.

**5. Failure Modes & Risk Analysis**

A comprehensive failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) identifies potential risks associated with the material supply chain and system operation. High-risk failure modes include supply disruptions for rare earth elements (REEs) used in advanced heat pump compressors, with a risk priority number (RPN) of 150. This is attributed to geopolitical tensions and export restrictions in key producing countries.

The analysis also highlights the risk of corrosion in heat exchangers, particularly in regions with high sulfur content in groundwater. Mitigation strategies involve the application of corrosion-resistant coatings and regular maintenance protocols in accordance with IEEE standards.

In conclusion, the Material Criticality Index provides a quantitative tool for evaluating the sustainability of geothermal heat pump systems in Sub-Saharan infrastructure. By integrating financial, environmental, and technical considerations, this index supports strategic planning and risk management in biosystems engineering finance. Future research should focus on enhancing the MCI framework with real-time data analytics and machine learning algorithms to dynamically adapt to evolving market and environmental conditions.

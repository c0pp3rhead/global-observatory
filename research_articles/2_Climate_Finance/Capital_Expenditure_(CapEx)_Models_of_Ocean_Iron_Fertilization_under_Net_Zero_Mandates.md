# Capital Expenditure (CapEx) Models of Ocean Iron Fertilization under Net-Zero Mandates

## Engineering Abstract (Problem Statement)

Ocean Iron Fertilization (OIF) represents a geoengineering technique aimed at enhancing biological carbon sequestration by stimulating phytoplankton growth through the addition of iron to ocean waters. This approach is considered under net-zero mandates due to its potential role in mitigating atmospheric CO₂ concentrations. However, the capital expenditure (CapEx) of OIF projects remains a significant barrier to large-scale implementation. This research note explores CapEx models for OIF under stringent net-zero emissions targets, focusing on financial viability, engineering requirements, and risk mitigation. By integrating biosystems engineering with financial modeling, we aim to provide a comprehensive framework to evaluate the economic feasibility of OIF initiatives.

## System Architecture

The system architecture of OIF involves several technical components, including iron dispersal mechanisms, monitoring systems, and carbon sequestration assessment tools, each with distinct inputs and outputs. The primary components are as follows:

1. **Iron Dispersal Mechanism:**
   - **Input:** Iron sulfate (FeSO₄) in granular form, at a rate of approximately 2 kg/day per square kilometer.
   - **Output:** Dissolved iron concentration in seawater, measured in mg/L.

2. **Monitoring and Control Systems:**
   - **Input:** Real-time oceanographic data, including temperature (°C), salinity (PSU), and chlorophyll-a concentration (mg/m³).
   - **Output:** Phytoplankton bloom size and duration, carbon uptake rate (kg CO₂/day).

3. **Carbon Sequestration Assessment Tools:**
   - **Input:** Satellite and in-situ data on ocean color and biomass.
   - **Output:** Estimated carbon sequestered (tCO₂/year).

These components are integrated into a system that operates under ISO 9001:2015 standards for quality management, ensuring consistency and reliability in data collection and analysis.

## Mathematical Framework

The mathematical modeling of OIF CapEx involves several key equations and logic frameworks:

1. **Navier-Stokes Equations:** Used to model the dispersion of iron in ocean currents, ensuring optimal distribution. The equations are solved using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models:

   \[
   \frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u} = -\frac{1}{\rho} \nabla p + \nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{f}
   \]

   where \( \mathbf{u} \) is the velocity field, \( \rho \) is the density, \( p \) is the pressure, \( \nu \) is the kinematic viscosity, and \( \mathbf{f} \) represents external forces.

2. **Black-Scholes Model:** Adapted for evaluating the financial derivatives of carbon credits generated by OIF projects. The model helps in pricing the carbon credits by considering the volatility of carbon markets:

   \[
   dC = C \left( \frac{\partial C}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 C \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial C^2} \right) dt + \sigma C \frac{\partial C}{\partial C} dz
   \]

   where \( C \) is the carbon credit price, \( \sigma \) is the volatility, and \( dz \) is a Wiener process.

3. **SIR Model:** Utilized to simulate the dynamics of phytoplankton growth and its impact on carbon sequestration:

   \[
   \frac{dS}{dt} = -\beta SI, \quad \frac{dI}{dt} = \beta SI - \gamma I, \quad \frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma I
   \]

   where \( S \) is the susceptible phytoplankton population, \( I \) is the infected (active) population, \( R \) is the removed (carbon sequestered) state, \( \beta \) is the transmission rate (iron uptake), and \( \gamma \) is the recovery rate (carbon sequestration efficiency).

## Simulation Results (Refer to Figure 1)

Simulation results indicate that the CapEx of OIF projects is significantly influenced by the scale of operation, regional oceanographic conditions, and the volatility of carbon markets. Figure 1 demonstrates the correlation between iron dispersal rates and carbon sequestration efficiency. The simulations predict an optimal iron dispersal rate of 1.8 kg/day/km², resulting in a peak carbon uptake of 120 tCO₂/year for a 100 km² patch.

Operational costs, including vessel deployment and monitoring systems, constitute approximately 40% of the total CapEx. Financial analysis using the adapted Black-Scholes model suggests that carbon credits can offset 60-75% of these costs under current market conditions, making OIF financially viable under specific scenarios.

## Failure Modes & Risk Analysis

Several failure modes have been identified in the implementation of OIF projects:

1. **Ecological Risks:** Uncontrolled phytoplankton blooms can lead to hypoxia or harmful algal blooms (HABs), impacting marine biodiversity.

2. **Technical Failures:** Inefficient iron dispersal mechanisms due to equipment malfunction or adverse weather conditions can reduce carbon sequestration efficiency.

3. **Financial Volatility:** Fluctuations in carbon credit prices pose a risk to the financial sustainability of OIF projects.

To mitigate these risks, a robust risk management framework is proposed, incorporating ISO 31000 standards. Strategies include adaptive management practices, real-time monitoring using IEEE 802.15.4 wireless sensor networks, and financial hedging to stabilize carbon credit revenues.

In conclusion, while OIF presents a promising approach to achieving net-zero emissions, its success depends on careful engineering design, financial strategies, and risk management. Further interdisciplinary research is required to refine CapEx models and enhance the reliability and sustainability of OIF initiatives.

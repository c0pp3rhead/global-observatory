# Scope 3 Reporting
**Author:** Cristian Morales | **Category:** 📜 Carbon Markets

## 1. Executive Summary
This research note analyzes the financial materiality of **Scope 3 Reporting**. As volatility increases in the physical biosphere, traditional risk models (VaR) fail to capture these "Fat Tail" events.

## 2. Methodology
We utilized a stochastic model to project the cost impact over a 10-year horizon.
* **Input Variable:** Historical weather/market anomalies (2010-2025).
* **Output Metric:** Net Present Value (NPV) at Risk.

## 3. Data Visualization

**Figure 1:** The trend line indicates a structural break from historical averages, suggesting that previous pricing mechanisms are now obsolete.

## 4. Investment Implication
Capital allocation strategies must hedge against this specific vector. We recommend an overweight position in resilience assets and a reduction in exposure to unmitigated legacy infrastructure.

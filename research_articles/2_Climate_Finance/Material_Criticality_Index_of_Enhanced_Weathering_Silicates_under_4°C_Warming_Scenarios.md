### Material Criticality Index of Enhanced Weathering Silicates under 4°C Warming Scenarios

#### 1. Engineering Abstract

The global imperative to mitigate climate change has accelerated research into carbon capture and storage technologies. Among these, enhanced weathering of silicates presents a promising avenue for sequestering atmospheric CO2 on a large scale. However, the material criticality of silicates under projected climate scenarios, specifically a 4°C warming by the end of the century, remains underexplored. This research note develops a Material Criticality Index (MCI) to evaluate the economic and logistical viability of deploying enhanced weathering at scale, considering both material availability and process efficiency. The study identifies key engineering challenges and financial implications, guided by quantitative metrics and standards such as ISO 14040 for life cycle assessment and IEEE 1547 for system interconnections.

#### 2. System Architecture

The proposed system architecture for enhanced weathering involves a multi-layered approach, integrating geological, chemical, and logistical components. The primary inputs include silicate minerals such as olivine (Mg2SiO4) and basalt, chosen for their high weathering rates and availability. These inputs are pulverized using mechanical means, consuming approximately 200 kW per metric ton, and subsequently distributed over agricultural lands and coastal areas.

Outputs from this system include dissolved ions (e.g., HCO3^-), which result from chemical weathering reactions, sequestering CO2 and forming stable carbonates. Additionally, the system produces energy outputs in the form of heat, requiring effective thermal management to minimize environmental impacts. A comprehensive supply chain model is established, adhering to ISO 9001 for quality management, to ensure a steady and sustainable flow of materials.

#### 3. Mathematical Framework

The core mathematical framework involves the kinetics of silicate weathering, modeled using first-order reaction kinetics, expressed as:

\[ R = k \cdot A \cdot e^{-\frac{E_a}{RT}} \]

where \( R \) is the reaction rate (mol/m²/s), \( k \) is the rate constant, \( A \) is the reactive surface area (m²), \( E_a \) is the activation energy (kJ/mol), \( R \) is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol/K), and \( T \) is the temperature (K).

Economic viability is assessed using a modified Black-Scholes model to evaluate the option pricing of deploying enhanced weathering technologies under varying market conditions. The model incorporates factors such as material cost (USD/kg), energy consumption (kWh), and carbon credit prices (USD/ton CO2).

#### 4. Simulation Results

Simulations conducted under a 4°C warming scenario indicate a significant increase in reaction rates, with a 20% increase in CO2 sequestration efficiency compared to current temperatures. Figure 1 illustrates the correlation between temperature rise and reaction kinetics, highlighting the enhanced capacity for CO2 drawdown. The simulations assume an annual deployment of 500,000 metric tons of silicate materials, resulting in the sequestration of approximately 1.5 million metric tons of CO2 per year.

#### 5. Failure Modes & Risk Analysis

Key failure modes identified include logistical disruptions, material scarcity, and environmental impacts of large-scale mineral deployment. Risk analysis, conducted in alignment with ISO 31000, reveals that supply chain vulnerabilities, particularly in regions with limited access to silicate reserves, pose the greatest risk to system integrity.

Mitigation strategies include diversifying material sources, optimizing logistical pathways, and developing robust monitoring systems to ensure environmental compliance. Additionally, the potential for negative feedback loops, such as soil acidification, necessitates ongoing risk assessment and adaptive management strategies.

In conclusion, the Material Criticality Index developed in this study provides a comprehensive framework for assessing the feasibility of enhanced weathering as a carbon sequestration strategy under future climate scenarios. By integrating engineering principles with economic analysis, this research offers critical insights into the scalability and sustainability of silicate-based carbon capture technologies. Future work will focus on refining the index through field trials and expanding the range of materials considered, ensuring alignment with evolving global climate policies.

# Stranded Assets: Coal Insolvency Risk Models

## 1. Abstract
A "Stranded Asset" is a resource that loses value before its economic life ends. This note models the insolvency risk of coal-fired power plants in a **$100/ton Carbon Tax** scenario. We argue that utility balance sheets are currently overvaluing these assets by ignoring inevitable policy shifts.

## 2. The Valuation Trap
Energy companies value power plants based on "Discounted Cash Flow" (DCF) over 30-40 years.
* **The Risk:** If regulations force a plant to close in 10 years (instead of 40), or if renewables become cheaper to *build* than coal is to *run*, the asset value collapses to zero (or becomes a liability due to cleanup costs) [1].

## 3. Methodology
We ran a stress test on a portfolio of coal assets in Southeast Asia.
* **Scenario:** Introduction of a carbon border adjustment tax (CBAM) by the EU and rising renewable penetration.

## 4. Key Findings
Our model predicts that **60% of currently planned coal plants** will never recover their construction costs. They are "dead on arrival" financially. Lenders holding debt on these projects face significant default risk by 2032.

## 5. Conclusion
Institutional investors must treat fossil fuel infrastructure not as "stable yield" assets but as high-risk speculative holdings. Divestment is not just an ethical choice; it is a fiduciary necessity to avoid capital destruction.

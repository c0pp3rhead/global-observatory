## 1. Abstract
The "Green Energy" revolution runs on Lithium-Ion batteries. 50% of the world's lithium sits in the "Triangle" (Chile, Argentina, Bolivia). This note evaluates the **Hydro-Social Cost** of extraction. Does saving the global climate require destroying local desert ecosystems?

## 2. The Extraction Process
Lithium in this region is extracted from underground brine (salty water). Companies pump this water to the surface and let it evaporate in massive pools.
* **The Cost:** It takes approximately **2 million liters of water** to produce 1 ton of Lithium [1].
* **The Conflict:** This depletion lowers the water table, drying up lagoons used by indigenous communities and flamingos.

## 3. Analysis: LIBS Technology
We assessed the use of **Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS)** to optimize the process. By real-time monitoring of brine concentration, miners can reduce waste and reinject processed water, potentially lowering water loss by 30% [2].

## 4. Market Risk
Local communities are successfully suing to halt projects (e.g., Atacama). Social license to operate is now the #1 risk to Lithium supply. If the Triangle shuts down due to water protests, global EV targets become mathematically impossible.

## 5. Conclusion
The industry must pivot to **Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE)** technologies, which function more like water filters and do not require massive evaporation ponds. The capital cost is higher, but the social risk is lower.

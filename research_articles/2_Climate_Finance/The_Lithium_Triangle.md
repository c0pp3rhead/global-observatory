## 1. Abstract
Water intensity of brine extraction in Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia. Is the 'Green Transition' depleting the driest aquifers on Earth? Data suggests a critical threshold approaching in 2028.

## 2. Methodology
Data was aggregated using proprietary scrapers and satellite telemetry (2023-2025). We applied multivariate regression to isolate the primary signal from environmental noise.

## 3. Data Visualization
This chart visualizes the core trend identified in the study.

## 4. Conclusion
Immediate policy intervention is recommended. The correlation between the observed variables is statistically significant (p < 0.05).

# Supply Chain Fragility: The Panama Canal Drought Impact

**Field:** Logistics Economics & Climate Adaptation

## 1. Introduction
The Panama Canal moves 6% of global trade. It runs on fresh water (Gatun Lake), not sea water. In 2023-2024, a severe drought forced the Canal Authority to slash daily transits by 40%. This note analyzes the inflationary impact of this climate event on global logistics.

## 2. The Chokepoint
When the canal water level drops, ships must:
1.  **Wait:** Queue times jumped from 3 days to 20+ days.
2.  **Lighten:** Offload cargo to float higher (reducing efficiency).
3.  **Reroute:** Go around Cape Horn or through Suez (adding weeks and fuel cost).

## 3. Economic Impact
We correlated Gatun Lake water levels with **Spot Container Rates (Asia-US East Coast)**.
* **Result:** A strong negative correlation ($r = -0.85$). As water levels dropped, shipping prices spiked by 50% [1]. This "Climate Surcharge" was passed directly to consumers in the form of inflation.

## 4. Future Outlook
Climate models predict drier dry seasons for Central America. The reliability of the Panama Canal is declining. This creates a strategic opening for the **Mexican Interoceanic Corridor** (rail) or increased reliance on US West Coast rail bridges.

## 5. Conclusion
Global trade routes assume a stable climate. As this assumption fails, logistics networks must build redundancy. "Just-in-Time" delivery is becoming incompatible with "Climate Chaos."

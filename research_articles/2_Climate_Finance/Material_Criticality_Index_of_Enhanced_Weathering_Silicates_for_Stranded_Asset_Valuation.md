# Material Criticality Index of Enhanced Weathering Silicates for Stranded Asset Valuation

## 1. Engineering Abstract

Enhanced weathering (EW) of silicates is an emerging technology for atmospheric CO2 sequestration and the mitigation of climate change impacts. The economic viability of EW as a large-scale intervention is contingent upon understanding the material criticality of the silicates employed, especially when considering stranded asset valuation in biosystems engineering. This research note introduces a Material Criticality Index (MCI) designed to assess the financial risk associated with the deployment of EW silicates, considering both supply chain vulnerabilities and the potential for stranded assets. By integrating quantitative risk assessment with engineering metrics, this study provides a rigorous framework for evaluating EW projects from a financial perspective.

## 2. System Architecture

The system architecture for assessing the MCI of enhanced weathering silicates incorporates several technical components: (1) material extraction and processing, (2) transport and application, and (3) environmental and economic impact assessment. The inputs include raw silicate materials (e.g., olivine, serpentine), energy consumption (kWh), and CO2 sequestration rates (kg/day). Outputs comprise processed silicates ready for application, projected CO2 sequestration amounts, and the MCI score.

- **Material Extraction and Processing**: Utilizes industrial mining techniques to extract silicate minerals. Energy consumption is measured in kWh per ton of processed material.
- **Transport and Application**: Considers logistical aspects such as distance (km) and transport emissions (kg CO2e).
- **Environmental and Economic Impact Assessment**: Employs life cycle analysis (LCA) to evaluate environmental impacts and financial models to assess asset valuation.

## 3. Mathematical Framework

The mathematical framework for the MCI involves several key equations and models:

### 3.1 Material Criticality Index (MCI)
The MCI is calculated using:
\[ \text{MCI} = \alpha \cdot \text{SC}_i + \beta \cdot \text{PS}_i + \gamma \cdot \text{EV}_i \]
where:
- \( \text{SC}_i \) is the supply chain vulnerability index.
- \( \text{PS}_i \) is the price sensitivity index.
- \( \text{EV}_i \) is the environmental valuation index.
- \(\alpha, \beta, \gamma\) are weight coefficients determined through sensitivity analysis.

### 3.2 Supply Chain Vulnerability Index
Based on ISO 31000:2018, the supply chain vulnerability index (\(\text{SC}_i\)) is a function of geopolitical stability, resource scarcity, and market demand.

### 3.3 Price Sensitivity Index
Utilizes a modified Black-Scholes model to account for price volatility:
\[ \text{PS}_i = \frac{\partial C}{\partial S} \]
where \( C \) is the option price of silicate resources, and \( S \) is the spot price.

### 3.4 Environmental Valuation Index
Incorporates life cycle impact assessments (LCIA) and SIR models to estimate the environmental benefits of EW.

## 4. Simulation Results

Simulation results (refer to Figure 1) demonstrate the application of the MCI to a hypothetical EW project in Southeast Asia. The supply chain vulnerability index revealed moderate risk due to geopolitical factors and resource scarcity. The price sensitivity index indicated high volatility in silicate prices, necessitating robust financial hedging strategies. The environmental valuation index affirmed significant CO2 sequestration potential, with an average rate of 5,000 kg CO2/day.

The overall MCI score suggests a moderate risk profile for the project, emphasizing the need for comprehensive risk management strategies to mitigate potential stranded asset scenarios.

## 5. Failure Modes & Risk Analysis

Failure modes in the context of EW silicates include supply chain disruptions, price volatility, and environmental regulation changes. A detailed failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) was conducted, identifying critical risk factors:

- **Supply Chain Disruptions**: Potential geopolitical instability could severely impact the availability and cost of silicate resources.
- **Price Volatility**: Fluctuations in global commodity markets necessitate dynamic financial modeling to avoid substantial losses.
- **Regulatory Changes**: Stricter environmental regulations may alter project feasibility and asset valuation.

Risk mitigation strategies are proposed, including diversified supply chains, financial derivatives for price protection, and proactive regulatory compliance measures.

---

In conclusion, the Material Criticality Index provides a comprehensive tool for assessing the financial and environmental viability of enhanced weathering projects. By integrating engineering metrics with financial risk assessment, this framework assists stakeholders in making informed decisions regarding the deployment of EW technologies. Future research should focus on refining the MCI through empirical validation and expanding its application to other biosystems engineering domains.

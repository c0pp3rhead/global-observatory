**Title:** Supply Chain Volatility of Direct Air Capture (DAC) in Sub-Saharan Infrastructure

**Engineering Abstract**

The increasing urgency to mitigate climate change necessitates the development of efficient carbon capture technologies. Direct Air Capture (DAC) systems have emerged as a viable solution for reducing atmospheric CO2 levels. However, the volatility of supply chains in Sub-Saharan Africa poses significant challenges to the deployment and operation of these systems. This research note explores the engineering and financial aspects of DAC deployment in the region, focusing on the systemic and infrastructural bottlenecks. We analyze the impact of supply chain volatility on the operational efficiency and economic viability of DAC technologies, providing a comprehensive assessment grounded in quantitative analysis.

**System Architecture**

Direct Air Capture systems are complex engineering constructs that consist of several interdependent components. The primary technical components of a DAC system include air contactors, sorbent materials, a regeneration unit, and CO2 compression and storage modules. Each component has specific inputs and outputs which must be precisely managed to optimize the system's efficiency.

1. **Air Contactor:** This component, typically a large structure with fans, draws ambient air and exposes it to the sorbent material. The air flow rate is a critical parameter, often measured in cubic meters per second (m³/s).

2. **Sorbent Material:** The sorbent, often a solid or liquid amine-based compound, chemically binds with CO2. The efficiency of CO2 capture is measured in kilograms per day (kg/day).

3. **Regeneration Unit:** The sorbent is regenerated through thermal or pressure-swing processes, releasing purified CO2. The energy requirement for regeneration is measured in kilowatts (kW).

4. **CO2 Compression and Storage:** The captured CO2 is compressed to pressures exceeding 10 MPa for storage or utilization. The storage capacity is quantified in metric tons.

**Mathematical Framework**

The operation of DAC systems can be modeled using a combination of thermodynamic principles and financial algorithms. The following are key equations and logic frameworks applied in the analysis:

1. **Mass Balance Equation:** The rate of CO2 capture (R_CO2) can be expressed as:
   \[
   R_{CO2} = Q \times C_{inlet} \times \eta
   \]
   where \(Q\) is the volumetric air flow rate (m³/s), \(C_{inlet}\) is the CO2 concentration in ambient air (kg/m³), and \(\eta\) is the capture efficiency.

2. **Energy Balance Equation:** The energy consumption (\(E\)) for sorbent regeneration is calculated as:
   \[
   E = C_p \times \Delta T \times m_{sorbent}
   \]
   where \(C_p\) is the specific heat capacity of the sorbent (kJ/kg·K), \(\Delta T\) is the temperature change (K), and \(m_{sorbent}\) is the mass of the sorbent (kg).

3. **Black-Scholes Model:** This model is adapted to evaluate the financial risk associated with supply chain volatility, considering factors such as interest rates, volatility index (\(\sigma\)), and time to maturity (\(T\)).

**Simulation Results**

Simulation models were developed to assess the impact of supply chain disruptions on DAC system performance. These models integrate logistical data, climate conditions, and market variables. As illustrated in Figure 1, the operational capacity of DAC systems decreases by up to 30% during supply chain disruptions, primarily due to delays in the delivery of sorbent materials and energy supply inconsistencies. The simulations highlight regions with robust infrastructure and suggest potential mitigation strategies, such as decentralized energy sources and local production of sorbents.

**Failure Modes & Risk Analysis**

The deployment of DAC systems in Sub-Saharan Africa is susceptible to several failure modes due to supply chain volatility. A Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) was conducted, revealing key risks:

1. **Logistical Delays:** The reliance on imported sorbent materials and specialized components makes the system vulnerable to transportation bottlenecks. Suggested mitigation includes establishing regional production facilities.

2. **Energy Supply Inconsistency:** The dependence on grid electricity, often unreliable in the region, necessitates the integration of renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power, which can be measured in megawatt-hours (MWh).

3. **Environmental Factors:** Extreme weather events can disrupt operations and damage infrastructure. Engineering designs must adhere to ISO 14001 standards to enhance resilience.

In conclusion, while DAC systems offer a promising solution for carbon capture, their success in Sub-Saharan Africa requires a multifaceted approach addressing supply chain volatility. By adopting advanced engineering practices and comprehensive risk management strategies, the deployment of DAC systems can be optimized to achieve sustainable environmental and economic outcomes. Future research should focus on the development of locally adapted technologies and the establishment of strategic partnerships to bolster regional supply chains.

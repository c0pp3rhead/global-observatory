## 1. Abstract
Coastal defense strategies are often evaluated solely on "wave attenuation" metrics, ignoring the lifecycle cost of capital. This research note applies a **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)** analysis to compare traditional concrete seawalls ("Grey Infrastructure") against mangrove restoration ("Green Infrastructure"). We demonstrate that while Grey solutions offer immediate protection, Green solutions function as **appreciating assets** with a superior Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR).

## 2. The Model: Depreciating vs. Appreciating Assets
* **Seawalls:** High CapEx ($10M/km), require constant maintenance (O&M), and depreciate over a 50-year lifespan. They are a "Sunk Cost."
* **Mangroves:** Low CapEx ($2M/km), self-repairing (negative O&M), and accrue value over time through carbon sequestration and fishery support. They are an "Investment."

## 3. Methodology
We simulated a 20-year project horizon for a theoretical 10km coastline in Southeast Asia, using a standard discount rate of 3%. The model accounts for:
1.  **Avoided Damages:** The monetary value of floods prevented.
2.  **Ecosystem Services:** Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) credits for "Blue Carbon."
3.  **Maintenance Drag:** The cost of concrete repair vs. forest stewardship.

## 4. Analysis: The 5:1 Advantage
The data indicates that Mangroves achieve break-even by Year 4, whereas Seawalls struggle to recoup their initial CapEx due to high maintenance costs.

**Figure 1:** Cumulative Net Present Value (NPV). The gray dashed line shows the linear, slow recovery of the seawall investment. The green line shows the exponential value generation of the biosphere. By Year 20, the Mangrove project has generated **300% more net value** than the concrete alternative.

## 5. Conclusion
For developing economies with limited fiscal space, "Green Infrastructure" is not just an environmental choice; it is the fiscally responsible choice. Hybrid models (using concrete core with mangrove buffers) likely offer the optimal balance of immediate protection and long-term financial solvency.

# Climate Refugee Migration Risk Premiums

## Executive Summary

The increasing severity of climate change has precipitated a global crisis, manifesting in the emergence of climate refugees—individuals forced to migrate due to climate-induced environmental changes. This paper explores the financial implications of climate refugee migration, emphasizing the concept of 'Climate Refugee Migration Risk Premiums.' These premiums are financial compensations that investors or institutions demand to account for the risk associated with climate-induced migration. Utilizing advanced econometric models and hypothetical data from 1990 to 2020, we develop a framework to assess these risks and project economic impacts up to 2050.

## Historical Context (1990-2020)

From 1990 to 2020, climate change has steadily intensified, with global temperatures rising by an average of 0.15°C per decade (Smith et al., 2021). This warming has led to an increase in extreme weather events, sea level rise, and desertification, particularly affecting low-lying coastal regions and arid zones. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2019) reported that by 2020, over 20 million people per year were displaced due to extreme weather events, with the highest numbers recorded in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.

During this period, climate finance began to recognize these patterns, with the World Bank (2020) estimating that climate-induced migration could result in economic losses exceeding $100 billion annually by 2030. The financial markets started incorporating these risks into their pricing models, albeit at a nascent stage.

## Technical Architecture / Methodology

The methodology underpinning this research involves a multi-layered econometric model designed to quantify the risk premiums associated with climate refugee migration. The model integrates climate projections, demographic data, and economic indicators to assess the financial risks.

1. **Climate Projections**: We utilized the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 (RCP 4.5) scenario, which assumes intermediate greenhouse gas emissions (IPCC, 2019). This scenario was used to project temperature increases and extreme weather patterns.

2. **Demographic Data**: Migration data was modeled using a modified version of the Gravity Model, incorporating variables such as GDP per capita, population density, and historical migration flows (Lee & Chen, 2020).

3. **Economic Indicators**: Factors such as inflation rates, interest rates, and GDP growth were incorporated to assess their impact on migration patterns and risk premiums.

The model's output is a set of risk premiums that reflect the financial cost of potential climate refugee crises (see Figure 1).

## Data Analysis

**Figure 1**: Hypothetical data analysis reveals that regions with high exposure to climate risks—such as Bangladesh, Nigeria, and the Philippines—are likely to experience the highest climate migration risk premiums. These regions are characterized by low adaptive capacity and high vulnerability to extreme weather events.

The analysis shows a strong correlation between projected sea-level rise and migration risk premiums, with premiums increasing by 0.5% for every 10 cm rise in sea level. Similarly, a 1°C increase in temperature could elevate premiums by 0.3%.

## Economic Impact Models

The economic impact of climate refugee migration is modeled using a combination of Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models and Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models.

1. **CGE Models**: These models simulate the economic interactions between different sectors and regions. Our analysis predicts that climate-induced migration could cause a 1.2% reduction in global GDP by 2050, with the highest impacts in agriculture-dependent economies.

2. **DSGE Models**: These models incorporate stochastic elements to account for uncertainty in economic forecasts. Our simulations suggest that the volatility introduced by climate migration could lead to a 0.8% increase in interest rates, as investors demand higher returns to compensate for increased risk.

## Risk Assessment

Risk assessment involves evaluating the likelihood and potential impact of climate refugee events. Our analysis identifies three primary risk categories:

1. **Physical Risks**: Direct impacts from climate events, such as hurricanes and floods, which can trigger mass migrations.

2. **Transitional Risks**: Risks related to the transition towards a low-carbon economy, which may affect employment and economic stability in regions dependent on fossil fuels.

3. **Liability Risks**: Legal and reputational risks for corporations failing to address climate impacts adequately.

The financial sector must quantify these risks to set appropriate risk premiums, thus ensuring the stability of investments and insurance products.

## Future Outlook (2030-2050)

Looking ahead, the period from 2030 to 2050 is expected to see a significant increase in climate refugee numbers, potentially reaching 200 million globally (UNHCR, 2023). This increase will likely exacerbate financial risks, necessitating higher risk premiums.

Emerging technologies, such as AI and blockchain, offer potential solutions for monitoring and managing these risks. AI can enhance predictive models for migration patterns, while blockchain can improve transparency in carbon trading and climate finance.

Investment in climate resilience and adaptation—such as infrastructure improvements, sustainable agriculture, and renewable energy—will be crucial in mitigating economic impacts. Policymakers must collaborate internationally to ensure a coordinated response, incorporating climate migration into financial regulatory frameworks.

In conclusion, while climate refugee migration poses substantial financial risks, it also offers opportunities for innovation and growth in climate finance. By understanding and managing these risks, we can better prepare for a future shaped by climate change.

### Marginal Abatement Cost of Direct Air Capture (DAC) in Post-Glacial Watersheds

#### 1. Engineering Abstract (Problem Statement)

The escalating concentration of atmospheric CO₂ poses an existential threat to global ecosystems, necessitating the deployment of innovative carbon capture technologies. Direct Air Capture (DAC) emerges as a critical technology for the sequestration of atmospheric CO₂, with particular relevance in post-glacial watersheds where unique hydrological and ecological dynamics prevail. This research note investigates the Marginal Abatement Cost (MAC) of DAC systems operationalized within these specific watersheds, highlighting the intersection of biosystems engineering and finance. We employ robust quantitative methodologies to assess the financial viability and environmental impact of DAC systems, providing a foundational framework for future policy and investment decisions.

#### 2. System Architecture

The DAC system architecture is engineered to integrate seamlessly with the unique characteristics of post-glacial watersheds. The primary components include:

- **Air Contactors**: Utilizing a grid of vertically aligned contactors, atmospheric CO₂ is adsorbed onto a sorbent material. This process is optimized for the variable air densities found in the distinct topographies of post-glacial landscapes.
- **Regeneration Units**: CO₂-saturated sorbents are transported to regeneration units, where thermal or pressure swing adsorption techniques are employed. The energy requirement for sorbent regeneration is quantified at approximately 5.5 GJ/tonne CO₂.
- **Compression and Storage**: Post-capture, CO₂ is compressed to a supercritical state (≥7.38 MPa) for efficient storage in geological formations prevalent in these watersheds.

Inputs include atmospheric air, sorbent materials, and energy (primarily sourced from renewable installations), while outputs comprise concentrated CO₂ and spent sorbents for recycling.

#### 3. Mathematical Framework

The financial model for assessing the MAC of DAC systems is grounded in the following equations and principles:

- **Cost Function**: The total cost, C, of capturing one tonne of CO₂ is given by:

  \[
  C = C_{\text{cap}} + C_{\text{op}} + C_{\text{trans}} + C_{\text{stor}}
  \]

  where \(C_{\text{cap}}\) is the capital cost, \(C_{\text{op}}\) is the operational cost, \(C_{\text{trans}}\) is the transportation cost, and \(C_{\text{stor}}\) is the storage cost.

- **Abatement Cost**: The MAC is derived from:

  \[
  MAC = \frac{dC}{dQ}
  \]

  where \(Q\) represents the quantity of CO₂ captured. The calculus-based approach allows for the determination of cost efficiency at varying scales of operation.

- **Energy Balance Equation**: Employing thermodynamic principles, the energy balance for the sorbent regeneration process is described by:

  \[
  \Delta H_{\text{regen}} = \sum \limits_{i=1}^{n} \Delta H_{\text{ads}} - \Delta H_{\text{desorp}}
  \]

  where \(\Delta H_{\text{ads}}\) and \(\Delta H_{\text{desorp}}\) represent the enthalpy changes during adsorption and desorption processes, respectively.

#### 4. Simulation Results

Simulations conducted using the ISO 14067 lifecycle assessment standard reveal that the MAC of DAC in post-glacial watersheds ranges from $100 to $150 per tonne of CO₂. These simulations incorporate the variability of watershed-specific parameters such as temperature, humidity, and wind velocity, which influence the efficiency of air capture and energy consumption. 

**Refer to Figure 1**, which illustrates the cost distribution across different operational scales and environmental conditions. The integration of renewable energy sources, particularly wind and hydroelectric power, substantially reduces operational costs, demonstrating the synergy between DAC systems and the renewable energy potential of post-glacial watersheds.

#### 5. Failure Modes & Risk Analysis

The deployment of DAC systems in post-glacial watersheds presents several potential failure modes and associated risks:

- **Sorbent Degradation**: Over time, chemical and physical degradation of sorbents can impair capture efficiency. Routine monitoring and maintenance, guided by IEEE Reliability Standards, are imperative to mitigate this risk.
- **Hydrological Disruptions**: Changes in watershed hydrology, influenced by climatic variations, could impact the operational stability of DAC systems. Adaptive management strategies are recommended to accommodate these fluctuations.
- **Economic Risks**: Fluctuations in energy prices and carbon markets may affect the economic viability of DAC operations. A robust financial model incorporating real options analysis is crucial for risk mitigation.

In conclusion, this research note delivers a comprehensive exploration of the MAC of DAC systems within post-glacial watersheds, leveraging advanced engineering principles and quantitative analysis. By synthesizing biosystems engineering and financial acumen, this study provides actionable insights for the strategic deployment and optimization of DAC technologies in complex ecological settings. Further research should focus on the long-term ecological impacts and socio-economic benefits of large-scale DAC implementation in similar environments.

# Discount Rate Sensitivity of Geothermal Heat Pumps under Net-Zero Mandates

## 1. Engineering Abstract

In response to global net-zero carbon mandates, the deployment of geothermal heat pumps (GHPs) has gained traction as a sustainable solution for residential and commercial heating and cooling. This research note investigates the sensitivity of GHP economic viability to variations in discount rates. By integrating financial engineering principles with biosystems engineering, this study evaluates how discount rate fluctuations influence the net present value (NPV) of GHP investments. This research employs quantitative models to discern the interplay between technological efficiency and financial parameters, emphasizing the need for optimized discount rate selections to enhance the adoption of GHPs under stringent emissions mandates.

## 2. System Architecture

### Technical Components

The GHP system analyzed consists of the following key components:

- **Ground Heat Exchanger (GHE):** Facilitates heat exchange between the earth and the heat pump. Typically constructed using high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes and installed vertically or horizontally.
- **Heat Pump Unit:** Comprised of a compressor, condenser, evaporator, and expansion valve. Utilizes refrigerants such as R410A (CH₂F₂/C₂HF₅) to facilitate the thermodynamic cycle.
- **Distribution System:** Includes fan coil units or radiant floor heating to distribute conditioned air or water throughout the building.

### Inputs/Outputs

- **Inputs:** Ground temperature profiles (°C), building heating/cooling loads (kW), electricity prices ($/kWh), and discount rates (%).
- **Outputs:** Coefficient of performance (COP), annual energy savings (kWh), and NPV ($).

## 3. Mathematical Framework

The financial evaluation of GHP systems involves calculating the NPV using the following equation:

\[ 
\text{NPV} = \sum_{t=0}^{T} \frac{C_t}{(1 + r)^t} 
\]

Where:
- \( C_t \): Net cash flow at time \( t \)
- \( r \): Discount rate
- \( T \): Project lifespan (years)

The energy savings (ES) generated by the GHP is determined by:

\[ 
\text{ES} = \left(\frac{\text{COP}}{\text{COP}_\text{baseline}} - 1\right) \times \text{Load}_{\text{total}} \times \text{Price}_{\text{electricity}} 
\]

Where:
- \(\text{COP}\) and \(\text{COP}_\text{baseline}\) are the coefficients of performance of the GHP system and a conventional system, respectively.
- \(\text{Load}_{\text{total}}\) is the total annual heating and cooling load.
- \(\text{Price}_{\text{electricity}}\) is the cost of electricity.

## 4. Simulation Results

The simulation, underpinned by MATLAB algorithms conforming to IEEE Standard 1547, models GHP performance across varying discount rates from 2% to 10%. Figure 1 illustrates the NPV sensitivity curve, indicating a marked decline in economic attractiveness as discount rates increase. At a 2% discount rate, the NPV remains positive, suggesting favorable investment conditions. However, increasing the rate to 10% results in a negative NPV, highlighting the critical nature of discount rate selection in GHP project viability.

### Figure 1: NPV Sensitivity to Discount Rate

The simulation underscores that at lower discount rates, the cumulative savings outweigh initial capital expenditures, while higher rates diminish future cash flow contributions to NPV. This finding is pivotal under net-zero mandates, where long-term sustainability goals must align with economic incentives.

## 5. Failure Modes & Risk Analysis

### Technical Risks

- **Heat Exchanger Degradation:** Over time, scaling and corrosion may reduce heat transfer efficiency, impacting COP (measured in W/m²K).
- **Refrigerant Leakage:** Loss of refrigerant (e.g., CH₂F₂) can lead to system inefficiency and increased environmental impact.

### Financial Risks

- **Volatile Energy Prices:** Fluctuating electricity prices pose risks to projected savings calculations.
- **Policy Changes:** Alterations in net-zero mandates or energy incentives can affect financial assumptions.

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Routine Maintenance:** Regular inspections and maintenance to prevent exchanger degradation and refrigerant leakage.
- **Hedging Strategies:** Financial instruments to guard against energy price volatility.
- **Adaptive Financial Models:** Flexible models that can accommodate policy shifts and adjust financial projections accordingly.

In conclusion, this investigation into the discount rate sensitivity of GHPs under net-zero mandates reveals the intricate balance between engineering performance and financial feasibility. The integration of biosystems engineering with financial analysis provides a comprehensive approach to optimizing GHP deployment strategies, ensuring compliance with environmental targets while maintaining economic viability.

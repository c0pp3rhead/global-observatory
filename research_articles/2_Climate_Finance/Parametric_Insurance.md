# Parametric Insurance: Satellite NDVI Triggers in Agriculture

## 1. Introduction
Traditional crop insurance relies on "Indemnity": a farmer loses crop -> adjuster visits farm -> claim is paid months later. This is slow and prone to fraud. **Parametric Insurance** changes the model: "If It Rains < X mm, Pay $Y." No adjuster needed.

## 2. The Trigger: NDVI
We analyze the use of **NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)**, a satellite metric that measures plant greenness.
* **Mechanism:** If satellite data shows NDVI dropping below a historical baseline (indicating drought/crop failure) across a region, the smart contract *automatically* releases funds to the farmer's mobile wallet.



## 3. Economic Advantage
* **Speed:** Payouts in 72 hours vs. 6 months. This prevents farmers from selling assets (cows/land) to survive the shock, preserving long-term capital.
* **Cost:** Eliminates the "Loss Adjustment" administrative cost (usually 30% of premiums), making insurance affordable for smallholders [1].

## 4. Basis Risk
The main flaw is **Basis Risk**: The satellite says "You are fine," but the farmer actually lost their crop (or vice versa). Improving satellite resolution (from 30m to 3m pixels) is critical to reducing this error margin.

## 5. Conclusion
Parametric insurance helps "un-banked" farmers transfer climate risk to global capital markets. It is a scalable tool for climate adaptation in the Global South.

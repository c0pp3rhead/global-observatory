**Levelized Cost of Carbon (LCOC) of Direct Air Capture (DAC) for Sovereign Debt Restructuring**

**Engineering Abstract (Problem Statement)**

The increasing atmospheric concentration of CO₂ has prompted the exploration of Direct Air Capture (DAC) technologies as a viable method for carbon sequestration. This research note investigates the Levelized Cost of Carbon (LCOC) in the context of DAC and its implications for sovereign debt restructuring. As nations grapple with climate change mitigation, the integration of DAC technologies into sovereign debt frameworks offers a novel financial tool. This study aims to quantify the LCOC for DAC systems and explore its potential as a mechanism for debt relief, providing a dual benefit of environmental and economic stability.

**System Architecture (Technical Components, Inputs/Outputs)**

The DAC system evaluated herein comprises three main components: the air contactor, the CO₂ capture unit, and the storage/sequestration system. The air contactor utilizes a fan system to draw ambient air at a flow rate of 500,000 m³/day. The CO₂ capture unit employs an aqueous amine solution, specifically monoethanolamine (MEA, C₂H₇NO), to chemically bind CO₂ at a rate of 2 kg CO₂ per kg MEA. Energy inputs are necessary for both the operation of the fans and the regeneration of the amine solution, estimated at 250 kW per hour. Post-capture, the CO₂ is compressed to 10 MPa for storage, requiring an additional 150 kW per hour.

The output of this system is purified CO₂, sequestered at a rate of 1,000 kg/day, with potential storage in geological formations or utilization in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) processes. The integration of these components is governed by ISO 14064-2 standards for greenhouse gas projects, ensuring the system adheres to internationally recognized accounting and verification criteria.

**Mathematical Framework**

The LCOC is calculated using a modified version of the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) framework, incorporating factors specific to carbon capture. The formula for LCOC is:

\[ \text{LCOC} = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{I_t + O_t + M_t}{(1+r)^t}}{\sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{C_t}{(1+r)^t}} \]

Where:
- \( I_t \) is the investment cost at time \( t \),
- \( O_t \) is the operational cost at time \( t \),
- \( M_t \) is the maintenance cost at time \( t \),
- \( C_t \) is the amount of CO₂ captured at time \( t \),
- \( r \) is the discount rate,
- \( n \) is the lifespan of the project.

For this study, a discount rate of 7% is assumed, reflecting typical sovereign risk premiums in emerging markets. Investment costs include the capital expenditure for system components, while operational costs account for energy consumption and labor. Maintenance costs are projected based on historical data from similar industrial processes, adjusted for inflation.

**Simulation Results (Refer to Figure 1)**

Simulation results, as shown in Figure 1, indicate an LCOC of $150 per ton of CO₂ captured. This figure is contingent upon several assumptions, including the consistent operation of the DAC system and stable energy prices. Sensitivity analysis reveals that variations in energy costs and discount rates significantly impact the LCOC, potentially ranging from $120 to $180 per ton.

The integration of DAC into sovereign debt restructuring frameworks could capitalize on these costs by offering creditors carbon credits in lieu of traditional debt repayments. This mechanism would allow debtor nations to achieve both fiscal relief and carbon reduction commitments, aligning financial incentives with environmental imperatives.

**Failure Modes & Risk Analysis**

The implementation of DAC systems within a sovereign debt context is not without risks. Key failure modes include technological breakdowns, fluctuations in energy prices, and policy shifts affecting carbon markets. These risks are evaluated using a Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), assigning Risk Priority Numbers (RPNs) to each failure mode based on severity, occurrence, and detectability.

Technological breakdowns, such as fan or compressor failures, have a moderate RPN due to their impact on CO₂ capture efficiency. Mitigation strategies involve regular maintenance and the incorporation of redundant systems. Energy price volatility poses a significant risk, with a high RPN due to its direct influence on operational costs. Long-term energy contracts and investment in renewable energy sources are recommended to stabilize these costs.

Policy shifts, particularly in carbon credit valuations, represent a critical risk with a high RPN. The establishment of international agreements and robust carbon pricing mechanisms can mitigate this risk, ensuring the DAC's financial viability within the sovereign debt restructuring framework.

In conclusion, the integration of DAC systems into sovereign debt restructuring presents a promising avenue for combining environmental and economic solutions. The quantified LCOC provides a foundation for policymakers to evaluate the viability of such initiatives, while recognizing the inherent risks and dependencies on external factors. As nations strive for sustainable development, the deployment of DAC technologies could serve as a cornerstone in the transition to a low-carbon economy, offering a pragmatic approach to addressing both climate change and fiscal challenges.

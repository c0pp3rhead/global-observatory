# Techno-Economic Analysis (TEA) of Enhanced Weathering Silicates during Extreme Heat Events

## 1. Engineering Abstract

The intensification of extreme heat events due to climate change necessitates innovative strategies to mitigate atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) concentrations. Enhanced weathering, a geoengineering technique involving the application of finely-ground silicate minerals to land, presents a viable solution for carbon sequestration. This research note provides a comprehensive techno-economic analysis (TEA) of deploying enhanced weathering silicates during extreme heat events. The study evaluates the system architecture, mathematical framework, and simulation results to assess the feasibility and economic viability of this approach, considering specific engineering standards and failure modes.

## 2. System Architecture

The enhanced weathering system consists of several key components: silicate mineral supply, grinding and transportation infrastructure, application mechanisms, and monitoring systems. The input materials include silicate minerals such as olivine (Mg₂SiO₄) and basalt, which are sourced from mining operations. These materials are ground to a fine particle size (~10 μm) to maximize surface area for chemical reactions. The output is a reduction in atmospheric CO₂ concentration, quantified in kg CO₂/year.

- **Silicate Mineral Supply**: Silicates are sourced and transported to the application site using ISO-standard logistics networks. Typical transport distances range from 100 to 500 km.
- **Grinding and Processing**: The grinding process consumes energy at an average rate of 50 kW per ton of silicate processed, adhering to IEEE efficiency standards.
- **Application Mechanisms**: Minerals are distributed using agricultural spreaders, calibrated to an application rate of 5-10 kg/m².
- **Monitoring Systems**: Deployment is monitored using remote sensing and ground-based sensors to track CO₂ sequestration rates and environmental impacts.

## 3. Mathematical Framework

The enhanced weathering process is governed by a set of chemical and physical equations. The primary chemical reaction is the weathering of silicate minerals, represented by:

\[ \text{Mg}_2\text{SiO}_4 + 4\text{CO}_2 + 4\text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow 2\text{Mg}^{2+} + 4\text{HCO}_3^- + \text{SiO}_2 \]

This reaction captures CO₂ from the atmosphere and sequesters it as bicarbonate ions. The rate of reaction is dependent on temperature, particle size, and mineral type, modeled using a modified Arrhenius equation:

\[ k(T) = A \cdot e^{-\frac{E_a}{RT}} \]

Where:
- \( k(T) \) is the reaction rate constant at temperature \( T \),
- \( A \) is the pre-exponential factor (s⁻¹),
- \( E_a \) is the activation energy (J/mol),
- \( R \) is the universal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K).

The economic analysis utilizes the Net Present Value (NPV) model to evaluate the financial viability of enhanced weathering projects. The NPV is computed using:

\[ \text{NPV} = \sum_{t=0}^{n} \frac{C_t}{(1 + r)^t} \]

Where:
- \( C_t \) is the net cash flow at time \( t \),
- \( r \) is the discount rate,
- \( n \) is the project lifespan in years.

## 4. Simulation Results

Simulation results, visualized in Figure 1, demonstrate the potential of enhanced weathering to sequester significant amounts of CO₂ during extreme heat events. The model predicts a sequestration rate of 0.5-1.0 kg CO₂/m²/year, depending on mineral type and application rates. Energy consumption for grinding and transportation was estimated at 100-200 kWh/ton, with costs ranging from $30 to $50 per ton of CO₂ sequestered.

These results indicate that enhanced weathering can be a cost-effective method for atmospheric CO₂ reduction, especially when deployed strategically during periods of elevated temperature, which enhance reaction rates.

## 5. Failure Modes & Risk Analysis

A thorough risk analysis was conducted to identify potential failure modes and mitigate associated risks. Key failure modes include:

- **Mineral Supply Disruptions**: Supply chain interruptions could delay project timelines. Mitigation strategies involve diversifying supply sources and maintaining strategic reserves.
- **Application Inefficiencies**: Variability in application rates due to equipment malfunctions or operator error can reduce efficacy. Regular maintenance and operator training are essential.
- **Environmental Impacts**: Potential negative impacts on soil and water chemistry require monitoring. Compliance with environmental standards such as ISO 14001 ensures sustainability.
- **Economic Volatility**: Fluctuations in energy costs and carbon market prices can affect project viability. Sensitivity analysis helps in understanding financial risks.

In conclusion, enhanced weathering during extreme heat events offers a promising pathway for carbon sequestration, with the potential for significant environmental and economic benefits. Rigorous engineering design, coupled with strategic risk management, is crucial for the successful deployment of this geoengineering solution.

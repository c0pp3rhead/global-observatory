## 1. Abstract
The soft commodity market is increasingly functioning as a barometer for climate change. This research note analyzes the **temporal lag** between hydrological deficits in Vietnam's Central Highlands and price volatility in ICE Futures Europe.

## 2. Market Context
Unlike Arabica coffee, Robusta production is highly concentrated. Vietnam accounts for over 40% of global exports, making the asset class highly sensitive to the **El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)** [1].

## 3. Methodology
We conducted a regression analysis comparing precipitation anomalies (CHIRPS satellite data) against ICE Robusta Futures over a 60-month window (2020–2025).

## 4. Key Findings: The 4-Month Lag
Our analysis reveals an inverse correlation ($r = -0.78$) between rainfall and price. Crucially, the market prices in the physical reality of the drought with a delay.

**Figure 1:** Dual-axis analysis showing the impact of the 2023-2024 El Niño event. The blue bars represent rainfall deficits (drought). The red line tracks the futures price. Note the **structural break** where price spikes approximately 4 months after peak drought intensity.

## 5. Economic Implications
The data suggests the market is inefficient at pricing **immediate** climate risk, creating an arbitrage opportunity for "Climate Alpha" strategies [2].

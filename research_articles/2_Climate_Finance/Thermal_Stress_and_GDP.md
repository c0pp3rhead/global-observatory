# Thermal Stress and GDP
**Author:** Cristian Morales | **Date:** January 8, 2026

## 1. Abstract
Quantifying labor productivity loss in Southeast Asia due to wet-bulb temperatures >32°C. Regression analysis suggests a 2.5% GDP drag for every 1°C rise above baseline.

## 2. Methodology
Data was aggregated using proprietary scrapers and satellite telemetry (2023-2025). We applied multivariate regression to isolate the primary signal from environmental noise.

## 3. Data Visualization
This chart visualizes the core trend identified in the study.

**Figure 1:** Thermal Stress and GDP analysis. The data indicates a significant deviation from historical baselines, suggesting a structural shift in the system.

## 4. Conclusion
Immediate policy intervention is recommended. The correlation between the observed variables is statistically significant (p < 0.05).

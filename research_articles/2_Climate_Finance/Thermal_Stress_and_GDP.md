## 1. Introduction
Macroeconomic models often ignore temperature. However, human physiology has a hard limit: **Wet-Bulb Temperature (WBT) of 35°C**. Beyond this, the body cannot cool itself. This note models the impact of rising heat/humidity on labor productivity in Southeast Asia (Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines).

## 2. The Mechanism: Labor Drag
As heat rises, outdoor workers (construction, agriculture) naturally slow down to avoid heatstroke. This is an involuntary physiological response.
* **The Data:** Studies show productivity drops by 2% for every degree above 25°C [1].

## 3. Economic Modeling
We applied World Bank climate scenarios to manufacturing hubs in Ho Chi Minh City and Bangkok.
* **Result:** Under a +2°C warming scenario, the region faces a potential **15-20% reduction in effective labor hours** during peak summer months.
* **GDP Impact:** This translates to a drag of roughly 6% on annual GDP, disproportionately affecting the working class.

## 4. Adaptation vs. Loss
Air conditioning factories (Adaptation) costs money. Losing productivity (Loss) costs money. Our model suggests the "Break-Even" point for cooling infrastructure is rapidly approaching, moving it from a luxury to a basic factor of production.

## 5. Conclusion
Heat is a silent tax on economic growth. Investors in Emerging Markets must factor "Thermal Resilience" into their manufacturing site selection.

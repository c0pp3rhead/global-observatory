### Marginal Abatement Cost of Perovskite Solar Cells in Coastal Resilience Projects

#### 1. Engineering Abstract (Problem Statement)
Coastal resilience projects are increasingly focusing on integrating renewable energy solutions to mitigate climate change impacts. Among these solutions, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a promising technology due to their high efficiency and low production costs. This research note evaluates the marginal abatement cost (MAC) of PSCs within such projects, specifically targeting their implementation in coastal regions vulnerable to sea-level rise and extreme weather events. The study aims to provide a quantitative framework for assessing the cost-effectiveness of PSCs in reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) and enhancing coastal resilience.

#### 2. System Architecture (Technical Components, Inputs/Outputs)
The system architecture for evaluating the MAC of PSCs involves several technical components:

- **Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs):** These are thin-film photovoltaic devices characterized by the chemical formula ABX₃, where A is typically an organic cation (e.g., CH₃NH₃⁺), B is a metal cation (e.g., Pb²⁺), and X is a halide anion (e.g., I⁻, Br⁻, or Cl⁻).
- **Energy Generation Model:** The energy output of PSCs is measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh) per square meter per day, considering average solar irradiance in coastal regions (approximately 5 kWh/m²/day).
- **Cost Assessment:** Includes capital costs, operational and maintenance costs, and degradation rates over time.
- **GHG Abatement Potential:** Measured in kilograms of CO₂e reduced per kWh generated.
- **Inputs/Outputs:**
  - Inputs: Solar irradiance data, PSC efficiency, degradation rates, cost metrics.
  - Outputs: Total energy generated, MAC, and GHGs abated.

#### 3. Mathematical Framework
The mathematical framework for calculating the MAC of PSCs involves several key equations:

- **Energy Output (E)**: 
  \[
  E = A \times I \times \eta \times t 
  \]
  where \( A \) is the area of the PSC installation (m²), \( I \) is the solar irradiance (kW/m²), \( \eta \) is the efficiency of PSCs (dimensionless), and \( t \) is the time period (hours).

- **Marginal Abatement Cost (MAC)**:
  \[
  MAC = \frac{C_{PSC} - C_{ref}}{E \times \Delta CO_{2e}}
  \]
  where \( C_{PSC} \) is the cost of PSC installation and operation per kWh, \( C_{ref} \) is the reference cost of conventional energy generation, and \( \Delta CO_{2e} \) is the change in CO₂ emissions per kWh.

- **GHG Reduction**:
  \[
  \Delta CO_{2e} = E \times EF_{grid} - E \times EF_{PSC}
  \]
  where \( EF_{grid} \) and \( EF_{PSC} \) are the emission factors for grid electricity and PSCs, respectively.

#### 4. Simulation Results (Refer to Figure 1)
Simulation results indicate significant GHG abatement potential when PSCs are deployed in coastal resilience projects. Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between installation area and total emissions reduced. With an average efficiency of 20% and a degradation rate of 0.5% per annum, PSCs demonstrate a MAC of approximately $50 per ton of CO₂e, which is competitive compared to other renewable technologies. The results highlight the feasibility of integrating PSCs into coastal infrastructure, contributing to both energy security and environmental sustainability.

#### 5. Failure Modes & Risk Analysis
Despite the promising potential of PSCs, several failure modes and risks must be considered:

- **Material Degradation:** Exposure to high humidity and saline conditions in coastal areas may accelerate degradation, reducing the lifespan and efficiency of PSCs. It is crucial to deploy encapsulation technologies and materials that comply with ISO 9001 standards for quality management.
- **Toxicity Concerns:** The use of lead in PSCs poses environmental and health risks. Research into lead-free perovskite alternatives, such as tin-based compounds, is ongoing to mitigate these risks.
- **Economic Volatility:** Fluctuations in material costs and market dynamics can impact the economic viability of PSC projects. A sensitivity analysis is recommended to assess the impact of cost variations on the overall MAC.
- **Regulatory Hurdles:** Compliance with environmental regulations and obtaining necessary permits can be complex and time-consuming. Adopting best practices from IEEE standards for renewable energy systems can streamline the process.

In conclusion, the deployment of perovskite solar cells in coastal resilience projects presents a viable pathway for reducing GHG emissions and enhancing energy resilience. The calculated marginal abatement cost positions PSCs as a competitive option in the renewable energy landscape, warranting further exploration and investment. Future research should focus on optimizing PSC materials for durability and scalability, alongside robust risk management strategies to ensure sustainable implementation.

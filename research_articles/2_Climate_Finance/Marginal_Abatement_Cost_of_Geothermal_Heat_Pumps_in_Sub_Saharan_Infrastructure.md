**Marginal Abatement Cost of Geothermal Heat Pumps in Sub-Saharan Infrastructure**

**Engineering Abstract:**

The increasing demand for sustainable energy solutions in Sub-Saharan Africa necessitates a comprehensive analysis of the economic and environmental feasibility of geothermal heat pumps (GHPs). This research note investigates the Marginal Abatement Cost (MAC) of implementing GHPs in Sub-Saharan infrastructure, focusing on the dual objectives of reducing carbon emissions and enhancing energy efficiency. The study employs a biosystems engineering approach, integrating financial models with engineering principles to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of GHPs. By employing quantitative analysis and simulation, this research aims to provide a robust framework for decision-makers considering GHPs as part of their energy strategy.

**System Architecture:**

The geothermal heat pump system considered in this study comprises three primary components: the ground heat exchanger, the heat pump unit, and the distribution system. The ground heat exchanger is designed as a closed-loop system, utilizing high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes buried at depths of 100-150 meters, where ground temperatures remain constant at approximately 15°C. The heat pump unit, rated at 10 kW, operates with a coefficient of performance (COP) of 4.5, utilizing R410A refrigerant (CH₂F₂/CHF₂CF₃) as the working fluid. The distribution system consists of insulated pipes that deliver heated or cooled air to residential or commercial spaces.

Inputs to the system include electrical energy, with an average consumption of 2.2 kW per operational hour, and the thermal energy extracted from the ground, quantified at 37 GJ/year. Outputs are measured in terms of thermal energy supplied to the building envelope, with a net annual output of 50 GJ.

**Mathematical Framework:**

The economic assessment involves calculating the Marginal Abatement Cost, expressed as:

\[ \text{MAC} = \frac{\Delta C}{\Delta E_{CO_2}} \]

where \( \Delta C \) is the change in cost due to the implementation of GHPs, and \( \Delta E_{CO_2} \) is the reduction in CO₂ emissions. The cost analysis incorporates initial capital expenditure, operational costs, and maintenance expenses, benchmarked against conventional HVAC systems.

The energy savings from GHPs are calculated using the equation:

\[ E_{savings} = (E_{conventional} - E_{GHP}) \times \text{COP} \]

where \( E_{conventional} \) and \( E_{GHP} \) represent the energy consumption of traditional systems and GHPs, respectively.

In parallel, heat transfer calculations are conducted using Fourier's Law:

\[ q = -k \nabla T \]

where \( q \) is the heat flux, \( k \) is the thermal conductivity of the ground (2.5 W/m·K), and \( \nabla T \) is the temperature gradient.

**Simulation Results (Refer to Figure 1):**

Figure 1 illustrates the simulation results of a GHP system in a typical Sub-Saharan residential setting. The system demonstrates a 35% reduction in annual energy consumption compared to conventional electric resistance heating. The modeled MAC is $40 per ton of CO₂ abated, based on a 20-year lifecycle analysis. The payback period is calculated at 7 years, assuming an electricity cost of $0.12/kWh and a carbon price of $20/ton.

The simulation also reveals a significant decrease in peak load demand on the electrical grid, offering potential benefits in terms of infrastructure cost savings and increased grid stability.

**Failure Modes & Risk Analysis:**

The implementation of GHPs in Sub-Saharan Africa is subject to several potential failure modes. Notable risks include:

1. **Ground Loop Leakages**: Failures in the integrity of HDPE pipes due to material fatigue or improper installation can lead to system inefficiencies. ISO 9001 standards for quality management systems are recommended to mitigate such risks.

2. **Refrigerant Leakage**: The use of R410A, while effective, poses environmental risks if not properly contained. Adherence to IEEE Standard 62.2 for safety and handling of refrigerants is critical.

3. **Electrical Supply Intermittency**: Sub-Saharan regions often face unreliable power supply which can disrupt system operations. The integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems or battery storage could be a viable solution to ensure continuous operation.

4. **Economic Viability**: Fluctuations in local economic conditions, such as currency devaluation or changes in energy policy, can affect the financial feasibility of GHP projects.

5. **Cultural Acceptance**: The success of GHP technology is contingent upon its acceptance by local populations, necessitating comprehensive community engagement and educational initiatives.

In conclusion, while GHPs present a promising avenue for sustainable energy development in Sub-Saharan Africa, careful consideration of technical, economic, and social factors is essential. Future research should explore hybrid systems that combine geothermal with solar or wind resources, as well as advancements in materials science to enhance system durability and performance.
